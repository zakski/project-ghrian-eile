A Collection of Documentation and Software relating to Other Suns, a role-playing game published by Fantasy Games Unlimited in 1983.

1st and 2nd Edition of Other Suns was written by Niall C. Shapero.

The Documentation comes from a smattering of usenet archive sources, hoboes.com has better formatting that the crude methods I used to rip the data from 
google groups, however it does not record the actual dates the messages where originally sent. So I will use both, hoboes filling in for what google groups did 
not record, but primarily taking the information from google groups.

## Other Suns 2nd Edition Manual
This comes from the unfinished (as far as I know) 2nd Edition draft of the RPG. It was published on usenet between 1990-1991 alongside the 
iceworld supplement. Consists of posts 0-2 by John Redden.

## Other Suns Ice World Supplement
The Ice World supplement contains sample random encounters, arctic equipment and a description of the harsh conditions. Its unclear which version of the rpg 
it targeted. Consists of posts 17-30 by John Redden.

    
    

## Other Suns 1st Edition Star System Generator
The code itself comes from USML, the universe simulator mailing list which was active for a short period at the end of the 80's start of the 90's. It seems 
to be based on the 1st edition ruleset, but without a copy in my hands I cannot confirm this for certain.

This code was written between 1983-1984 by Sean R. Malloy.

## Addendum
This is very much a side project that I will work on formatting when tracking down the accrete code gets a bit slow.
