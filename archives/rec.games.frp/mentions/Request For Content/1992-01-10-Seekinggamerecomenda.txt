TITLE: Seeking game recomendations and sources 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Friday, 10 January 1992 00:10:54 UTC - Terry A. Newton:
I am trying to identify wholesale sources for games and supplies in order 
to stock the inventory for a small store.  I am also trying to solicit
suggestions for less mainstream games to stock.  By less mainstream, I
mean outside of the larger publishers (TSR, Mayfair, AH, GDW etc.)
I was wondering if anyone would be willing to send me e-mail with
address/phone numbers of possible sources that they might have experience
with.

I would also appreciated suggestions of games that you personnaly know 
and would recomend to other players, especially newbies, to try.  Descriptions
would be greatly appreciated.

I am located in the Los Angeles area, but would consider sources outside
of this area.

Thank you for your consideration, and hopefully we can spread the the hobby.

Well, if you're interested in slightly "off brand" sorts of merchandise, 
there is OTHER SUNS (second edition to be out Real Soon Now) with a 
publisher in the greater LA area...
