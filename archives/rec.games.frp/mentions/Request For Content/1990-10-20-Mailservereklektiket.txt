TITLE: Mail server eklektik, etc.

Unfortunately, I've been very busy of late, and my computer seemed to
get away from me, sending mail to who knows where.  The eklektik mail 
server should now be operating correctly.  (As should the RM list, but
no one seems to be posting to it.)
Since the Traveller digest is being archived elsewhere, I've moved those
files offline to save disk space.  Perhaps the montly posting should be
changed to reflect this.

Also archived on eklektik is stuff from rec.music.dylan, in case you
have exceptionally good taste in music and are interested.

Since I haven't been reading this group recently, I have a few questions:

1) The Adaz & Sutekh stories now being posted- are those the same
that appeared in 1988 or are they new?  If new, I'd like to get a copy
of them.

2) I've saved Other Suns parts 8-30 to add to the archive, but I missed
parts 1-7.  If someone would mail them to me, I'll get them all online
so people can request the parts they missed.

3) Anything else people want archived?  Since I started this archive I have
had ONE (count it, one) unsolicited submission and from 20-40 requests
a day.  This seems a bit unbalanced to me.  This semester I just don't have
time to read this newsgroup and save useful articles.

Thanks!
