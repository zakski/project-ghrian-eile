TITLE: Other Suns in Aust.

Â I hope someone can answer this question. Is Other Suns available
within Australia and if not an address in the U.S.A were a copy

of the game can be purchased. Also I'd like to know how many people

have succeded in having their gaming material published as I have

been working on my own Sci-Fi Rpg for some time.
