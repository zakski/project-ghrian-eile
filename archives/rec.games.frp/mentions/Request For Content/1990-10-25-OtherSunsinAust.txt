I don't know if OTHER SUNS is available in Australia or not; it was published by FANTASY GAMES UNLIMITED, INC. in 1983 (October, to be precise) and has been 
out of print for about two years (FGU is, for all intents and purposes, no longer doing business).  There were some 2500 copies in the distribution pipeline 
for which I never received royalties, and it should be possible to pick up a copy SOMEWHERE in the US.  I've picked up a few extra copies myself by ordering 
them at my friendly local neighborhood g





aming store (cost locally is around $20).

Not sure how much the overseas postage would be, if you're really desparate, you could always buy from yours truly (I've only got a few copies of the game, 
though, until we get finished with the 2nd edition and print some of THOSE up).

Well, this humble (?) individual has gotten his RPG published (along with a couple of articles and a gaming supplement).
