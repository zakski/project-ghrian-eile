TITLE: More RuneQuest Experience 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wednesday, 12 July 1989 01:30:55 UTC+1 - Eric Rowe;345 Mulford;x3-9092:
The following is posted at the request of a friend who has just said
farewell to his account but wanted to say a few last words about
runequest experience.

     I like the RuneQuest system, but it seems mandatory that every RQ 
player make up their own "better" Experience system.  Well, here's 
mine, and the reasons why I like it.  But first, an explanation of why I 
did my own experience system...
    I do like most of the features of the system put forth in RQ III, 
especially the way it scales for the various skill levels.
   To sum up this scaling, the rate of skill increase for ordinary checks 
is:
X x (1-X)  for skill levels less than 100%
and
X x (1- Bonus) for high skill levels.

    This is fine and dandy, but there are still problems with RQ's system:
The "frenzy," where characters frantically run around trying to succeed in 
each of their skills only *once*.  Once they have done this, they don't 
bother trying that skill any more.
    This problem is caused by the fact that the only one check is needed to 
increase the skill in question, and only one check is possible per 
adventure.  Why should a character bother using a skill again once he's 
gotten his "check?"
    The other problem I've had with the system is that character 
advancement is really slow.  It just takes forever to make any significant 
improvements in characters, unless they do a lot of training...

     This leads to my New and Improved RQ Experience System:

Basically, the normal RuneQuest Experience Check system is still used, but 
the characters may get multiple Experience Checks in the same skill.  
However, these multiple checks get harder to get the more they have.

To be specific:
The first Check in a skill only requires a normal success.
The second in the same skill requires a special (or better) success.
Further checks require a critical success.

These checks are then resolved at the end of adventure, as in the normal RQ 
rules for experience.  However, for simplicity's sake,  skill increases 
between checks is neglected.  I.e. make the experience checks all against 
the same skill level.

There are some further (optional) modifications to this system:
Characters may get multiple checks for very good rolls the first time they 
use a skill. i.e. If a character gets a special or critical success the 
first time they use skill, they get two checks.


But that's basically the whole of my system.  Here's a brief example to 
show how it works:
   Using good old Cormac, back when he has a 80 skill in his axe attack 
skill.  He gets thrown into a gladiatorial duel.  His attack rolls for the 
five round duel are: 60, 40, 10, 10, 02 (the critical defeats the foe).  He 
gets three experience checks:  One for the 60, a normal success.  He needs a 
special for the second check, so the 40 got him nothing, but the 10, a 
special, did.  The 02 was a critical, and gives him the third check.  If 
the critical hadn't have ended the duel, he could have gotten more checks 
may making more critically successful attacks!
   Later that week, while he is recuperating from wounds received in a less
successful duel, he may resolve any gains he might have gotten from 
experience.  His player rolls for the 4 experience checks Cormac has (he 
got another critical before being knocked out...) and gets 66,98,32,78.  
For his skill of 80 (+6 bonus), he needs a 75-100, so the 98 and 78 are 
successful checks, and Cormac's skill in axe attack goes up by 2d6.  Note 
that had the skill increase of individual checks been taken into account, 
the 78 might not have been a successful experience check.


Here are some comments on the advantages and disadvantages of this 
experience system:

Advantages:
  1) It is very much like the normal RQ experience system.
  2) The experience gains generally follow the normal RQ rates of increase.
  3) Characters will improve faster.  (maybe a disadvantage)
  4) Skills that are used frequently will improve faster than ones only 
used rarely.
  5)  There is incentive to use a skill even after a character has gotten 
his "check."
  6)  It is a simple system that doesn't require a lot of paperwork or 
interruption of flow of play!

Disadvantages, and possible fixes:
  1)  Characters with very high skills (200+) may be increasing too fast as 
they can easily get critical successes!
      Fix:  Well, these characters should probably be Heroquesting anyway.  
And for that they're probably going to need a high rate of skill increase 
for just to survive!
      If it is still a problem, only allow 3 checks, or require HyperCrits, 
etc for further checks (See Steve Maurer's Heroquesting rules for details 
on really awesome HyperCrits and such!)
  2)  The frenzy is still possible, though it is more blatant (and there is 
less incentive).  For example:
   "I succeed in my sword attack!  That's one check, but I'll need a special 
for the next one, so I punch the next round!  Gee, successful fist attack 
for a fist attack check!   Better go back to sword, 'cuz it's more likely I 
can special that for its second check!"  and so on...
    If this problem arises, just make all the checks for similar skills 
(like all melee weapon attack skills) used within a period (say, 5 minutes) 
are treated as the same skill difficulty.  I.e., in the example above, the 
fist attack would need a special for the check, even though it was the 
character's first check in fist attack.  And if he switched back to sword 
after getting a special in fist attack (for the check), he would need a 
critical to get any sword check!
    This fix may hurt sorcerors who use a variety of spells however, unless 
their spells are deemed non-similar skills.


    I must admit that this system hasn't been playtested much.  It does 
look good on paper (well, to me, at least), so I'm posting it for comment.

Eric Mehlhaf (I hope I spelled that correctly) presented a nice system
there. I especially like the analysis of possible problems.

The system I used back when I played RQ was to give +1% to the experience
roll for each additional check. I never ran a campaign long enough to know
how well this would work. It requires a little more paperwork but is still
simple.
Another problem with RQs system (and Hero Games and GURPS) is the definition
of 'adventure'. If you get one check per adventure then the epic adventure
which took 7 sessions is worth no more (or little more) than the adventure
which took one 2 hour session. One fix to this is to give the ep per some
number of hours of playing, or per month or week or whatever of gametime.

In the SFRPG _Other Suns_, whose working title while under development
was 'Runes in Space' (the game designer originally wanted to sell it
to Chaosium until he couldn't get a reasonable contract out of them,
then changed the RQ-specific mechanics and sold it to FGU), the skill
improvement mechanic takes usage into account.

The base skill improvement chance is max(100-%age,0) + INT on D100. To
this base chance is added 1% for every normal success at the skill,
+5% for every 'clean' success (RQ Impale equivalent), and +10% for
every critical success. This is normally handled during play by making
tickmarks on the character sheet (you _do_ use sheet protectors or
have your character sheets stored on a computer, don't you?), and
referenced when the session is over.

Ah good ole Other Suns. The other working title I heard was By the Light of
Other Suns. I'm not surprised that got shortened.

I had forgotten that. Yes, sheet protectors are a must. I first bought
sheet protectors when I was running RQ.

When FGU ran into financial problems, they let Other Suns go out of
print, which under the terms of the contract Niall had with them meant
that publishing rights reverted to him. He is now in the process of
doing an update and rewrite of the Other Suns rules and the
scenario/world/race supplements, most if not all of which never saw
the light of day (_Ice World_ is apparently being folded into the
basic rules set; I'm not sure what is being done with the supplement
on the Auuri or the notes on minor races in the Hegemony).

The new rules set is going to be released as shareware on disk; I
believe registration will get you a printed set. Also, Niall has set
up an evening-and-weekends BBS which has an _Other Suns_ area on it.
The BBS is hooked into FidoNet, and a couple of other sysops are going
to be getting feeds of the _Other Suns_ traffic. If anyone is
interested, send me mail, and I will send them the number for the BBS
(it's at home right now, and I'm not).
