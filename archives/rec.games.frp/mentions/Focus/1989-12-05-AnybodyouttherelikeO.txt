The question says it all... is anyone out there familiar with the SF/morphic
RPG, Other Suns?  I've heard a few good things about it, and I know the author
is coming out with a revised version soon; does anyone out there have any
comments on the game?  (Oh, and I sort of know the author (via BBS), so if you
have any suggestions for improvements, feel free to give them to me, and I'll
pass them on...

The _author_ is quite literally putting out a revised version --
since FGU anulled Nicolai's (his name's really Niall, but I've never
heard anyone but Kay call him that) contract by allowing the game to
go out of print, all rights reverted to him, and he's putting the new
version out himself. Last time I talked to him, he was going to be
offering a set of rules on disk, with a more expensive printed set
available. This will let him provide revisions to the rules easier, as
well as giving him more control about what the game looks like (for
example, I saw the sample ship illos for the Alderson Yards Shipbook,
and they make what FGU eventually published look like trash).

I've seen some of the changes that he's making, and he appears to be
simplifying the mechanics a bit -- certainly the character creation
has streamlined somewhat. A lot of the changes appear to be in the way
the rules are laid out -- when it got collected and edited for
publication by FGU, some sections wound up in inconvenient locations.

Like most RPGs, the enjoyment the players will get depends heavily on
the gamesmaster -- the scenarios I played in that Nicolai ran were a
lot of fun, varying from the strange to the totally bizarre. Next time
you call the BBS, see if Kay has her writeup of the "We're all Bozos
on This Bus" scenario online -- a ship crewed entirely by H'reli . . .
except for the Bjoran captain. Nicolai's publishing the game himself
will also allow him to include all the background material on the
Hegemony that had to be cut from the FGU edition -- and the amount of
background information you have makes a _big_ difference in how well
you can build the universe the characters play in. There's a _lot_ of
stuff that never made it into the FGU rules set.

  Other Suns? That ,in my opinion, happens to one of best (if not forgotten
 by most).
 Three suggestions for the new edition :
 1. more data on the L'Doran Hegemony. Give it an entire book.
 
 2.A few star maps would help.Remember to keep the ships just as fast
   if not faster.

 3.Get better publicity this time, it was a great game but the only
   reason I ever got it was because I was bored,had some cash, and
   there was a copy sitting on the bottom self in the back of the
   store (little did I know then how much I'd like it).

 Also ask the author if he's willing to take submissions (for
 supplements or whatever).

        Two addtions to OtherSuns that should be made simplifed character
creation (i.e. don't need computer to do it) and a place to draw characters
with the possiblity of blank poses on the character sheet.  Also starship
creation should be simplifed.  Also a source book this means at least 40
pages perferably 1000 pages if not more. 

        
        Beyond that is almost the best if not the best SF game out there in
my mind (the only one I run upto now I tring a couple of others but will
probley come back to it).

Niall Shapero runs the StormGate Aerie BBS, (213)822-6729. I believe
he's got a Courier HST modem, so he'll take up to 9600 baud
connections. The BBS is part of FidoNet, but I'm not sure what his
node number is; a number of other FidoNet nodes get the Other Suns
feed from his machine.
If you have suggestions about what you want to see in the new release
of the game, or have ideas for a supplement you want to do, call the
BBS and leave a message to him about it; he'll almost certainly
respond within a day or two.
