TITLE: Other Suns RPG 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Monday, 11 December 1989 17:18:45 UTC - John Redden:
A number of questions about Other Suns have been posted to the net.  After
speaking to the author of the game, Nial Shapero, he asked me to post 
his BBS number for anyone interested.  The number is (213)
822-6729.  This machine is running msdos and is on Fidonet.  There
are "echos" (similar to news groups) on this machine.  Much of the
discussion is about Other Suns and space gaming in general.  (BTW
If anyone has a gateway from Fidonet to Usenet please send me mail).
I know that there is a second version of the game planned.  The original
was based on RuneQuestI and was at one time to be released by Chaosium
as "Runes In Space".  This will give you a feel of what *some* of the
mechanics are like.  The games runs well in exploration and first
encounter scenarios and political episodes between the Hegemony and other
space groupings.  You have to be a fairly decent number cruncher to run
the game.

If you want an interesting story, ask Nicolai sometime _why_ he broke
off negotiations with Chaosium as a publisher. In a nutshell, Chaosium
wanted _all_ rights to the game, and Nicolai balked -- but his story's
a bit more colorful.

The mechanics are as much similar to RuneQuest as they are to any
other game that uses percentile-based skills in categories with skill
bonuses based on characteristics. He had to make a number of detail
changes to generalize the mechanics to the point where Chaosium
couldn't hit him for copyright violation (computation of skill
bonuses, for example; also certain terms, such as 'clean success' vice
'impale')

Nicolai has already printed parts of the character creation section of
the new Other Suns rules in an APA (Amateur Press Association -- a
group of people who write zines at regular intervals [generally a
month or two], make enough copies for all the members, and give them
to the editor/collator, who assembles the zines and distributes the
issue) that he and I are both members of. The computations for skill
bonuses have changed again, and the layout has been improved somewhat;
it's now a bit easier to understand what's going on.

To handle political episodes correctly, it really takes more
background on the L'Doran Hegemony and the other political entities
than FGU was willing to leave in the rules; some of the games
Nicolai's run that I've been in have wound up extremely twisted in
this regard -- like the mission where the security officer fumbled a
roll at the wrong time and fingered as an L'Drey spy not the _real_
L'Drey spy but another character entirely, and the judicial antics
following _that_.

Exploration can be a lot of fun on both ends, running the game and
playing in it. There are enough bizarre things you can do to the
characters without actually _killing_ them (I have a character who has
two skills at 1000% [that's _not a typo] as a result of a chance
encounter with a _really_ bizarre alien: 'Gluon Sculpting with a Pion
Shaper' and 'Appreciation of Gluon Sculptures' [really useful skills,
right?] -- and who also spent some time as a clam as a result of it
[don't ask]).

There are a number of things that got left out of the FGU rules that I
only found out about from playing in games Nicolai ran. Some of the
background on the Skiltaire and how to deal with their telepathic
abilities (ask Nicolai about Trochii battle stations sometime), for
example. The telepathic otters with multi-AU telepathic ranges, if
you've forgotten, where a prime source of annoyance for a GM is their
making a telepathic sweep of a system for intelligence. Toss in a
Trochii relic once, and the Skiltaire will be less of a problem in the
future -- once burned, twice shy.
