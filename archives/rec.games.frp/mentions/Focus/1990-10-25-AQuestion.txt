I've been running a BBS on FidoNet for some time now, and the OTHER SUNS material is from a conference that I moderate on that net.  John Redden, who has had 
access to usenet for a good deal longer than I have, has been collecting the material there and thought it would be nice to post the material here.  Some of it 
has been background material from my campaign, some of it stories (again, from my campaign) and some of it is either rules modifications or supplementary rules 
materials.  OTHER SUNS itself was








 an SFRPG published by FANTASY GAMES UNLIMITED (and written by yours truly).

Other Suns is a SFRPG written by Niall C. Shapero, and published by Fantasy Games Unlimited.  Which game company appears to have gone the way of all things 
mortal, so Niall has reclaimed his rights to it and is working on a new revision with a lot of new stuff, to be published both electronically (as shareware, 
basically) and hard copy (with the original illustrations by Ken Sample and Fa Shimibo, and possibly some new ones.)  StormGate Aerie hosts an echo devoted to 
Other Suns, which John Redden calls up






and reads occasionally, and evidently has been serializing material from there in here.  Some of it is rules and species for the game; he's also included some 
stories I've written based on games (WE'RE ALL BOZOS ON THIS BUS, and CATS, FOXES AND SQUIRRELS INC.)
