OTHER SUNS, published in 1983, was an SFRPG that was NOT
humanocentric.  That was seven years ago.  GURPS UPLIFT
will hardly be the first.

        That's an understatement if I ever read one. The human
worlds were part of *four* separate 'states' run by the really
powerful races, a bit like the way Macedonia is divided up
between Greece and ...um. That funny shaped nation to the north
of Greece. Damn, I need an atlas at the store.

        Humans have the collective clout in interstellar affairs
slightly smaller than Portugal's in the current world. Earth has the
clout of Hiroshima in late August of 1945. There are species that are
stronger, higher tech, 'smarter', and have much more reliable psionic 
abilities than Humans do. On the other hand, we have all the best songs.

        Near as I could figure from the illo's, the various races
genocide everyone who isn't a cute fuzzy animal (or a crab). I
guess that mutual cuteness helps decrease the normal xenophobia
intelligent animals feel for each other.

Hear, hear!  We should also mention Albedo, and Justifiers and even (gasp)
Star Frontiers (had alien PC classes).  Also Traveler (and offshoots) have
always provided the possibility for Alien roleplaying. 

This seems to be a common attitude that GURPS people possess, and one that
is encouraged by SJG themselves (loud claims of being the FIRST at anything,
whether true or not, I find pretty objectionable), but I suppose each to his
own.

Well, no - the original Traveler was very heavily pegged towards humans, 
with the assumption that nobody would want to play anything else (one of
the things I didn't like about it when it first came out.)  They only
added aliens as PCs much later when they saw that people wanted to play
them.

As one of the more vocal members of the group you just plastered this
statement over, I'm a bit puzzled.  I don't think I've seen many
claims that GURPS is the *first* to do something -- certainly SJG doesn't
promote it that way.  (Well, maybe a little about being the first
truly "generic" RPG, which I would agree is debatable, but that's the
only thing I can remember.)

Now if you wanted to complain that many GURPS players will claim it's
the *best* system for something, and that SJG encourages that, I could

see your point.  Most of the people here on rec.games.frp seem to have
some religious leanings toward one system or another, though -- it's
not confined to us GURPS players.

Yes, but like the Christians, GURPS players seem to be the most vocal and
bent on conversion.

Certainly it has that effect on some people.  I also suspect it's more
popular than many of the other AD&D alternatives, so there are more of
us to hear from.  However, I don't recall seeing any GURPS players
trying to start a crusade to eliminate the heathen infidels who play
AD&D....

As a rule, I try to avoid outright strong-arm tactics to get people to
look at GURPS.  However, if someone here asks a question which I
consider merits a reply, and I think GURPS is relevant, I'll discuss
it.  I expect other people to do the same for other systems that they
advocate.

Hmm, I think I'll accept that analogy.  Given the world-wide population
of Christians, less than 1% are "vocal and bent on conversion" about
their Christianity.  So I'll accept those same figures for GURPS players.

Just another reason everyone should try to put the game-system discussed
in the subject line - Jon can then kill offensive GURPS proselytizing
just as I kill other game-system proselytizing (which seems to me to be
about the same as GURPS - sorry, Jon).  BTW, I do feel that
GURPS posters are pretty good at putting the game system name in the
heading, though most fans of non-TSR products are, too - and even some of
those are good at it.
