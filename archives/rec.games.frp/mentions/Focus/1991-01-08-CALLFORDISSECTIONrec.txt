I vote yes for whatever, but I think I would prefer the following:

        1. rec.games.frp -- anything and everything that is currently here. 
        2. rec.games.frp.stories -- stories, scenarios, characters,
                        and miscellaneous roleplaying experiences.
        3. rec.games.frp.ref -- net spellbooks, monster manuals, game
                        system rules, new weapon/armor/etc descriptions.

I'm also not sure we need a moderator.  This is a fairly free-form news
board.  IMHO there is no need to change it drastically.  These suggestions
should ruffle fewer feathers than your above splits.  People who don't
choose to post to the new boards (#'s 2 & 3) wouldn't have to.  The two
boards I suggested adding would take a significant amount of noise out of
the main board.  I think there might be enough interest in all of them to
stay alive, too.

Tell me what you all think about the 3-part split.

Well I don't think anyone would want to moderate the stuff.
and there are too many seperations..

I'd prefer a "gernral discussion" and a "Source of new Ideas"

so ya gripes would go in one, ya new spells in the other...

Seems that a 2 way split would give a break to everyone..

I think this proposal is ideal, with a modification or two, of course. ;-)
The movement as of late is to avoid making a name both a hub for
subgroups and an active group.  We should rename r.g.frp to r.g.frp.misc
if we split.  Also, I believe that r.g.frp.ref is a poor choice for
a group name since the abbreviation is very non-obvious for people
who speak English as a second language, which is a growing segment
of the net.  I would prefer .reference to .ref, but I bet someone else
can come up with a name that is better than both.  Any takers?

I personally like only having to check one topic for all the
role-playing info. If people really want to divide it, I would do it
by games.
rec.games.rpg.adnd                   Advanced Dungeons & Dragons
rec.games.rpg.hero                Hero System
rec.games.rpg.RQ                Rune Quest
rec.games.rpg.pbm                Play by Mail

Agreed. I prefer unmoderated groups. And r.g.f.stories can also contain
discussions pertaining directly to the stories, and ref (or what ever)
can contain a bit of discussion about the docs..


|> The movement as of late is to avoid making a name both a hub for

r.g.frp.misc
I think this has stayed this way for too long to get changed. 
However, I'm not sure that having a .misc wouldn't be such a bad
idea. It could contain sources, announcements to con's, stuff
not covered by the general group, and we save r.g.f for discussion only.

Or we could do what we usually do when someone suggests splitting
r.g.frp (which is about every 6 months or so), we could just leave
things the way they are.  Very few people think there is a problem, so
why change anything?

I agree, with the most part, to most of the above suggestions.
Here's where I differ.  Rec.games.rpg.d and rec.games.rpg.misc could collapse
into one without any problem.  I don't quite know the difference between
"reference material" and "software" when speaking of games.  Perhaps a more
intuitive split would be rec.games.rpg.source for rules addenda and
rec.games.rpg.campaign for modules and campaign materials.
I do believe that a moderator would help in the .source and .campaign groups
since such a person would facilitate compilation.  This, of course, does not
mean that I support such a person acting a censor.


Splitting the groups along genre would be workable, but cumbersome, at least to
a person who prefers to jot from genre to genre.  Furthermore, some think
things may not quite fit one genre.  Keeping the groups genre independent would
prevent bandwidth eating crossposts in such cases.


Splitting groups along game systems is just plain silly.  Reason one:


rec.games.rpg.adnd
rec.games.rpg.dnd
rec.games.rpg.coc
rec.games.rpg.ept
rec.games.rpg.rq
rec.games.rpg.gurps
rec.games.rpg.othersuns
rec.games.rpg.traveller
rec.games.rpg.twilight
rec.games.rpg.champions
rec.games.rpg.hero   (still parallel with the superhero game, champions, but
                         not identical.)
rec.games.rpg.marvel
rec.games.rpg.dc
rec.games.rpg.paranoia
rec.games.rpg.cns
rec.games.rpg.traveller2000
rec.games.rpg.shadowrun
rec.games.rpg.cyberpunk
rec.games.rpg.otherrealms
rec.games.rpg.rqII    (For the real RuneQuest snobs)



am I making my point?  The above list is hardly exhaustive.

Secondly, I'm not a one-game munchkin.  Furthermore, I like looking over 
the comparative discussions and the system-independent discussions.

(I don't like the D&D munchkins vs. the world flame wars.  Could the 
mature AD&D/D&D players speak up once in a while?  I know you exist, and there
are a lot of you.)


In short, I vote for my version of the "function-dependent" split (of course),
or for some sort of function-dependent split.
I would tolerate, but not vote for a genre-dependent split.
I most vehemently vote against a game-dependent split.

Well, this subject comes up all the time.  I am for it, but the problem lies
in convincing the rest of the net (who get to vote on the issue) that we do
really need it.  Keep in mind, many of them have no idea of what an rpg is!
I will help support it as necessary, and would even be willing to collect
the votes, but if this is gonna pass, we gotta do it by the rules and have to
hustle to collect votes.

Just my .02 cents worth.

I personally would prefer the larger split.  Why?  Well I would like to archive
the posted stories, and reference materials, but I have no interest in using
my disk space for other peoples characters.  (No offense to the character
posting people, but they are either not usable in my campaign, or they are too
unbelieveable to be allowed in my campaign).

I would not mind moderating one of the three above.  It might ensure that junk
is kept down, and having a moderated group devoted to one particular topic 
might start to encourage the archive sites to start archiving the groups.  So
when someone first gets on the net 6 months from now, they don't have to post
45 messages asking for everyone to send him/her everything that has passed
through here.


>Seems that a 2 way split would give a break to everyone..
But it wouldn't provide the proper filtering to get the archive sites to look
our way.  I could't see anyone wanting to archive 150 postings of characters
in the "New Ideas" section you proposed of characters that have 95-100% of
the maximums allowed, 20 magic items, and a personal place in their favorite
dieties court.  However, if  we specifically had a stories group, and a group
for resources such as the spell books, etc., and finally one for sources and
binaries, people would know exactly what would be found there, and those that
wanted to specifically archive that type of material could.

Sorry, I don't like the looks of this.  rec.games.rpg already exists,
and I don't know that it's all that well propagated.

Besides, there are just too many splits here.

.d:  I hate .d groups.

.source:  There isn't *all* that much software getting posted.  What
does go across is usually posted once, then put on an ftp site or
emailed.

.characters:  Maybe.  But I think the vast majority of posted
characters are champions sheets.

.stories:  Another maybe.

.ref:  Hmm.  I think this is in reaction to lots of requests for the
net books by new users who haven't seen all the talk about them.  I
don't know if the three-line "Me, too, please" posts are worth their
own group.

.misc:  I hate .misc groups.  I don't know what goes there.

BREWSTER'S IDEAS:

rec.games.frp.gm <http://rec.games.frp.gm>                gm forum
rec.games.frp.players                players forum
rec.games.frp.fiction                fiction

My thinking is that most posts are either centered around "playing" or
"gming", and the pigeonholing should be obvious.  Posts that concern
both playing and gming should go to playing.  the .gm subgroup should
be reserved for gm-specific stuff.

Of course, subject lines should still reflect the nature/system of the
post.

Examples:

RUNEQUEST:  Spells
AD&D:  Playing Paladins and Cavaliers
CoC:  New Character Classes

Note that stories would no longer need to be labelled "STORY", since
it would have its own group.

  I also like this three part split.  I am not one to read most messages
on here that doesn't concern AD&D, yet I see no reason to break the
group into anything smaller.  I do have a problem reading the stories
because there are som many that I just don't have time to read them all.
I think breaking this up would help out because then I can just leave
them unread until I do get some time.  Count me in as a second vote.

I think splitting the group might be advantageous, simply because
lots of the "Net XXX Book" postings are really large.

But I disagree that SIX groups are really needed! How about just TWO:

        1. a main group for miscellaneous general discussion,
           rules questions, debates about classes vs. skills,
           calls for help, etc.

        2. a reference or resource group for reference materials,
           like the net books, Tabolport (if something like that
           comes around again), character sheets, programs, etc.,
           and also for stories.

As far as names go, I don't mind "rec.games.frp" at all, although
I see the point of those who want to call it "rec.games.rpg."

I guess the first group should be called "rec.games.[frp|rpg].d"
or "rec.games.[frp|rpg].misc", although the ".d" suffix leaves me
cold (not sufficiently descriptive).

The second group could be called "rec.games.[frp|rpg].ref" or
"rec.games.[frp|rpg].resources".

Again, I DON'T think there is any need for SIX groups! Splitting
it into two groups should do just fine. Besides, some of those
proposed six groups would see little traffic, so why bother 
creating them? (I haven't seen more than a dozen characters
posted here in the last several months - they surely don't
warrant a group of their own for just 12 posts!) Ditto ".source".

And, do we need a moderator? People who mis-post will surely be
flamed to a crisp without any moderator's interference needed.

> Tell me what you all think about the 3-part split.
I prefer it to the bigger split!! The only comment I might add is that
in the time reading this newsgroup, the only other split one might
desire is among classes of rpgs - tech vs. fantasy (i.e., magic-based
versus non-magic-based), with GURPS, of course, blurring the
distinction. I think the three-way split would lighten traffic to the
point where we need not worry about this much, but we all *might* want
to consider splitting the main group (frp per se) into 
rec.games.frp.magic
rec.games.frp.tech
and, if this riles up GURPSers, then add rec.games.gurps
and leave the stories and refs groups as is, giving 4 or 5 groups with
minimal overlap (for smaller kill files ;-)

Here is for contradicting my previous statement:
I, for one, was unaware that there was a rec.games.rpg group.
I have heard it mentioned before, but our reader here at
UCD doesn't get it. I wonder if I will have the same problem
if r.g.frp splits into groups... Am I the only one with this
problem? And what is wrong with killing the files you just
can't bear to read? I think that more descriptive subject
lines would solve a few problems.

I like the way rec.games.frp.resources sounds. It also makes sense; all

Question:
Why?

Either
A) You read most of the posts and hit 'n' real fast and set up kill files
to deal with games/posters/whatever you don't want to see.
B) You read articles to only certain games, in which case you hit '=' so
as to see all the titles and pick out the games.

The problem I see with most of the suggested splits(maybe all, dunno) is
that either people want to split it into a lot of groups, many of which
will get 3 posts a year, max...split it by games, where most articles that
apply to games apply to all games...or split it by ref/player, where most
people who have played for any length of time, are interested in both
anyway.

I proposed a different split a few months ago, and got a lot of flame,

I'm not in favor of it.  How much software do we get posted to
this group?  Maybe two or three pieces per month?  Same for reference
material, etc.  There's not enough traffic to split rec.games.frp.

Better than six groups, but still not needed.  The purpose of making
a new group is to draw off traffic that is obscuring the discussion
of topics in the original group.  rec.arts.startrek is a good 
example.  Star-trek discussions were overwhelming the rest of the
traffic in rec.arts.sf-lovers. 

Do we have that much traffic in frp? No.  Do we have traffic that's 
obscuring other discussions?  No. The Other Suns stuff might be a 
candidate, but I find a KILL file works just as well.

So, leave it alone, and let's not discuss this for another six 
months.

1. rec.games.frp  -  General discussion, trying to change the name is just
                        too much hassle.
2. rec.games.frp.aid  -  Adventures, characters, monsters, spells, etc.
                        (all the things that are currently being compiled,
                        plus any modules people wish to create and share).

Don't even think about splitting by game types/systems, that is why this
group is still unified - too much of the discussions are independant of the
system to make such a split useful.  I like it that way, and I'm not alone.

Forget the moderators, too much work, not enough need.

Finally, an idea that I can almost live with.  I really would only have
two groups:

rec.games.frp.gm <http://rec.games.frp.gm>                 gm stuff (include net.books)
rec.games.frp.players            everything else, including fiction

I really feel that having the fiction in with the gaming stuff encourages
those who would be too shy normally to post, feeling that flames will
be lost in the crowd.  Also, I woundn't normally read a .fiction
group, but I will read some of the more interesting stories when they
are in the normal group.

I would also like to strongly discourage cross-postings.  If anything
is of use to players, stick it in the players group.  If anything would
be labled (or SHOULD be labled) SPOILER, then put it into the .gm group.

On the other hand, I'm really not bothered by the current grouping
(that is, everything mixed together).  I can rapidly skip anything I
don't like, or I can learn how to use a kill file analoge (assuming that
such things exist in the IBM mainframe world).

I've found that in the comp.sys.mac.* newsgroups too much stuff is
cross-posted.  I'd rather the smaller number of useful groups.
I read articles that I wouldn't otherwise read (I'd never read a
specific D&D group), and found that some things apply to my campaigns.

Oh, well, thats it for my two-cents worth.  I will vote when this comes
up for it, and I suspect that it will fall through, like always.
However, this is the most serious that I've seen splitting-fever in a
while, so who knows?

This has been discussed before.
I personally think this is a bad idea in general, and in particular
your suggestions are overkill. (Btw, I have never seen software in r.g.frp.)
I will vote against any such "dissection" of rec.games.frp.

If posters would just place KeyWords in the title of their posts
(preferably as the first word of the title), then KillFiles would
work just fine to accomplish the same thing as this proposed
reorganization.

The comparison to the Amiga groups is unfortunate.  The Amiga groups
have many times the number of postings of rec.games.frp.

I don't see the rec.games.frp group as very crowded (especially compared
to comp.sys.amiga); therefore, I do not see the need for the split.
On the other hand, many of you have brought up splitting the group up
so many times that if not a majority, you are certainly a vocal minority.

I feel that if there must be a split it should be a 2 or 3-way split, not
a six-way split.

rec.games.frp.misc  (or plain old rec.games.frp)
rec.games.frp.stories (perhaps)
rec.games.frp.resources (if you must)  (I think the .ref is to ambiguous)

Whatever you do, DO NOT SPLIT ON GAME SYSTEMS!!!!!!!!!!!

Regards,
Randy

  I agree.  I have no real problems with the group as it is.  Kill files
  can always be set up, and the 'n' key is always readily available for
  those net-books, stories, or whatever you just do not have time for.

I don't care for the idea.  I agree that rec.games.frp has its problems,
I don't recieve it here because the volume is so high.  However, I don't
think that this is the correct way to reorg the group.  I think a more
appropriate reorg would break the group into subcatagories based one
game system, not type of posting.  There was a tremendous volume of 
D&D, Hero System and GURPS postings when I was reading a year ago.
I was unable to find the articles I was interested in, those pertaining
to Runequest and Harn, because of this high volume.  I'd say for people
posting stories to add "STORY" in the subject line.

Please, move this discussion to news.announce.newgroups, which is a
forum designed for the purpose!! There are several reasons why a split
should not take place:

1: Splitting up leads to cross-posting (esp. with a *.misc-list in
there), thus INCREASING the network load.

2: As someone already said, splitting causes attention from the
administration, as the number of non-scientific discussions grows (I
now have 1092 entries in my .newsrc, of which 19 are comp.sys.amiga*
:) ), causing them to start rmgrouping. There isn't much chance of a
global rmgrouping, but, anyway...

3: It can be very frustrating to decide which sub-disc. to put a given
article in, unless there are guidelines, and who are to write them??
It will presumably end in a very active rec.games.frp.misc-list...

SOLUTION: Use kill-files instead, and use bright intelligent
news-readers like GNUS. :)

Wednesday, 9 January 1991 15:11:17 UTC - Nicolai Shapero:
Consider this, quite simply, a vote of NO on any split.  The whole
idea, as I understood it, for a newsgroup covering frp as a whole was
to allow one to get "everything at one gulp".  Using my off-line
reader, I don't have access to a killfile, so I sometimes have to hit
the "next message" key a few times in rapid succession to get past
those (multiple) posts that I'm not the least bit interested in.  But
if there's an uninteresting (to me) post, I just don't read it --
it's that simple.  And every now and then, a comment for a game that I
do not play will spark an idea for one of the games I DO play.  So I
do NOT want rec.games.frp split into two, three, six, or however
many different newsgroups -- if it splits into multiple groups, I'm
not interested in the additional hassles of getting multiple feeds
for newsgroups where only one message in a hundred is of interest to
me, but I am interested in seeing that one message in
a hundred.
Just my small change ($0.02 won't buy ANYTHING these days...)

Sorry, I just got back from the holidays. Why do we wish to split the group?
I think it is small enough to be handled. If there will be a split the above
three-way split gets my vote. More groups would bring lots of cross-posting.
A split making groups for all the different systems is about the most stupid
thing I have ever heard. I have some 40 different systems at home and can
easily come up with 40 more for you to cover.

too true. besides, all you have to do to change the name of the group

this is the only sort of split proposal that makes any sense. one group
for gms, one for players. that way gm's can post things without fearing
that their players will inadvertently read secret info about a campaign.

imho stories are mostly written from the players' point of view and
might as well go into that group, assuming this split has to be done at
all.

result. two groups:

rec.games.frp.gm <http://rec.games.frp.gm>
   would include gm stuff like scenario ideas, rules tinkering and
   design, and rules questions, etc.

rec.games.frp.player
   would include player stuff like stories, adventure summaries,
   character postings, and rules questions, etc.

note that champions and d&d rules questions would probably be
cross-posted to both groups. :-( the extensive cross-posting that would
likely result from a split is one reason I'm instinctively against any
such split.

I agree totally.  There hasn't been enough volume on r.g.frp to justify
splitting the group.  Kill files can easily control the volume and
type of news you want to read.  Why don't we all relax and utilize the
one group we have instead of creating six groups which are just
minor BS from the one good group. 

Just my opinion....

No, I don't think you're the only one with that problem.  Something like this
happened to me once before when one of my other favorite newsgroups was split:
I couldn't access the new group (which contained the material I wanted to read)
and my cries for help went unanswered; the original group stunk, and I never
read it again.  I don't want this to happen to rec.games.frp!  If I won't be
able to access the new groups, I'll be quite pissed! (especially since I
consider myself a fairly major contributor to the various net books).

I really don't see the need for a split; sure the net book postings are large,
but they occur quite infrequently (no more than once a week, as far as I can
tell).  So if we had a newsgroup dedicated to this, we would get a meaningful
post once in a great while (it takes a LOT of work to put one of these babies
together); other than that we would have people begging for a copy of this or
that book - seems like a wasted newsgroup.  Also, what happens when these net
book postings die out?  There goes the group!

As other people have mentioned, IF IT AIN'T BROKE (and it isn't) DON'T FIX IT!!
We can accomplish what we need to by using more efficient key words and kill
files (LEARN TO USE YOUR KILL FILES!!!!).  When an article comes up that you
don't want to read, skip it, kill it, or whatever.  But, just because you don't
want to read it, others may; why make it hard (or impossible) for some people 
to do so?

As for those of you who say frp is such a high volume group, there are groups
out there that are a lot worse (check out rec.arts.startrek which gets about 
double what frp does); if they don't need to split, why do we?  1000 articles a
month?  So what!!  That's only 33 a day; using kill files and the 'n' key, you 
can get thru that in no time.

In summary, 
USE YOUR KILL FILES EFFECTIVELY, AND LEAVE REC.GAMES.FRP THE WAY IT IS!!!!

New people going on the net who didn't see what happened the *last* time
it was brought up.  If you want to archive stuff, hit '=', find the articles
that have STORY in the first part of the post, then archive that specific one.
If you are on low baud, again hit 'n' or '='.  If the title says something
that you know you won't like, skip it.

Just for reference, virtually every subject comes up somewhere on the net

Part of the reason why people don't post "no, don't split the group" is
because we're sick of seeing "let's split the group" posts.  I'm always
tempted to just kill the topic, but paranoia always makes me read the
posts.
A good number of readers are from University or Educational sites, most of
which are on break right now.  When they get back, they'll see that they
are thousands of messages behind.  They'll catch up to most posts by
checking out what the subjects are (with =) and see hundreds of posts on
splitting the group, and just kill the topic (as I would if I were in
their position).  

If anyone really wants a split, I would suggest that whoever is organizing
the motion, wait at least 1 week (maybe even 2) and post a message with the
header being "IMPORTANT" rather than anything to do with reorganization.
That, I'm sure will attract some attention.  In that "important" post,
describe whatever procedure they want on voting, etc.  This way, most of
the rec.games.frp community will be involved.  (Hopefully anyway.)

Hoping for a good representative sample,

I'm not crazy about splitting the group.  Sure, there's lots of material
that goes through here, and lots of it is what I consider garbage, but
I don't have a problem wading through it to find material of interest to
me.  As another witty poster put it, it would be nice if the group was
split into "stuff I personally like" and "stuff I don't want to read."
But I'm willing to live with the bad to get the good.
If the net consensus requires a split, I stongly favor the suggested:
   *  rec.games.frp.misc:  discussion of general interest
   *  rec.games.frp.stories:  fiction and anecdotes about gaming
   *  rec.games.frp.resources:  net books, homebrew rules

I strongly reject any split along the lines of system or genre.  Many
articles are indeed of interest only to the players of a specific game.
However, many more are of much wider interest, covering a topic that
spans most or all systems and genres.  What's worse, some threads start
out as ostensibly system-dependent, only to mutate into generalized
discussion.

I posted this proposal a while ago, but I guess the message got
eaten by the line eater or something.  In any case, your proposal
is a good start, but it doesn't go nearly far enough.  We need to
have a very fine grained division of rec.games.frp to avoid anyone
possibly reading anything he isn't specifically interested in.

In any case, my proposal...

    * sci.math.frp - to discuss the underlying mathematics of fantasy
        role-playing games (e.g. Fantasy Hero)
    * sci.math.rpg - to discuss the underlying mathematics of role-
        playing games (e.g. Champions)
    * sci.math.stat.frp - to discuss the statistical aspect of fantasy
        role-playing games
    * sci.math.stat.rpg - to discuss the statistical aspect of role-
        playing games
    * sci.psychology.frp - to discuss the psychological implications
        and effects of fantasy role-playing games
    * sci.psychology.rpg - to discuss the psychological implications
        and effects of role-playing games
    * sci.physics.frp - hardcore discussion of physics in a fantasy
        role-playing game
    * sci.physics.rpg - hardcore discussion of physics in a role-
        playing game
    * soc.culture.frp - to discuss the fantasy role-playing game
        subculture and its relation with the mundanes 
    * soc.culture.rpg - to discuss the role-playing game subculture
        and its relation with the mundanes
    * comp.sources.frp - for source material used in fantasy role-
        playing games
    * comp.sources.rpg - for source material used in role-playing 
        games
    * rec.arts.frp - for fantasy role-playing game related stories
    * rec.arts.rpg - for role-playing game related stories
    * news.groups.frp - to discuss new fantasy role-playing game 
        newsgroups
    * news.groups.rpg - to discuss new role-playing game newsgroups

I am sure there are many other newsgroup ideas I have missed.
Please followup on this the discussion to news.groups.frp or
news.groups.rpg.  Since most of us only read one of those 
groups, please also cross-post what you post to one group to
the other.

I thank you, and the net thanks you.

By the way, I have come up with this truly great idea for a 
notesfile.  This bbs has grown so large that most of us cannot
follow all the discussions going on.  Often times some 
interesting thread would appear and disappear without most of
us noticing.  What we need is a newsgroup to announce the 
presence of interesting discussions so the rest of us can know
where to "tune in". 

Hey, the guy in the next cubicle is snickering.  He says we
should call this notesfile mod.ber.  Isn't he funny?  I thought
all the mod groups disappeared a couple of years ago.  And why
is he laughing?  I am SOOOOOOO confused.

But I don't want to KILL anything! I already have a kill file that
does me pretty well.

I want to SORT the articles. The volume of articles has been ranging
in the 30-60 range each day since I started reading this newsgroup
over a year ago. I think it would be a lot more convenient for me if
large articles like stories, spell book entries, and scenarios (to
pick a few examples) were in a separate newsgroup, so that I could
browse their Subject lines (using = in rn) to see what I want to
read now, what I want to read later, what I just want to ship off
to my home system without reading, etc. As for the general discussion
articles, I usually like to read them right away.

Sure, I can do that now with a single group, but it's inconvenient
to look through headers of 40 articles when I only need to see
the headers of 10 or so. No, I suppose it's not a big deal, but it
would be nice, and given a chance, I'd support an attempt at
splitting the group along the proposed lines.

No split along genre/game system, though! I like the discussions
all mixed together.

I agree whole heartedly with Vince.  Two groups are more than

I would suggest that rec.games.frp be left alone.  What is needed
is a rec.games.frp.long (ala BIX).  Anything over 40 lines should
go in the .long ng with a brief message in the base ng stating that
such and such book, story, software, etc. has been posted in the

This is a common misconception.  On most systems, a cross-posted message
creates only one file, with the exception of those people who are not
really on Usenet, but instead get an EMail feed.  There may be other exceptions,
but at least 90% of Usenet works this way.

A charter will have to be written before the vote can be held, according
to Group Creation Guidelines.  Where do you envision problems of decision
in the proposed 3-way split?

Now THAT I could go along with.  FAR less messy than the original idea.
But on the whole as long as people clearly identify reference, stories,
programs et all in the titles I don't think it's really necessary.  (And
would someone repost the "how to use killfiles on messages of the MY
GREATEST ADVENTURE part X variety" information on a regular basis to 
cut down on the "don't put the part number on the subject line" requests?  
When people do that it makes it hard to tell what you do or don't have.)

How about rec.games.frp.newgroup for all these discussions about
creating new groups?
sure, there may be about 1000 posts a month, but they are of such a broad
spectrum, that I don't think any justification of splitting up the rec.games.frpcan be made.

As far as I can tell , we get on this discussion whenever:

1) Some new game appears and everybody starts talking about that for a while.  Examples are Shadowrun and Champions 4th edition.  Each time, it was proposed 
we split the group up, and we didn't.  Notice how many posts about these games now, not much more than others.

2) Somebody complains about seeing posts about other games, and can't kill or n through the letters.  To that I say, "tough", because these people are much in 
the minority.


I actually prefer a group with a lot of posts in it.  It is easier to just jump
through themusing '=' or 'n'.  (listing them by subject).  Also, with the way we jump around between subjects so much, many of the groups will be empty most 
of the time.

for the record, I vote NO to a split.

It comes up every 2 (two, 2, that is 2, [1+1], get my drift, son!) months
because of:

1) New people are constantly subscribing to this group, and they are unaware of all the previous discussions.

2) A bunch of selfish dweebs feel that "their game" is the only game, and they

I understand reason number 1, because it is very reasonable for someone who doesn't know to ask to form a new group.

As for the people who fall under number 2, they should be ignored.

The problem is to distinguish between the people in number 1 and number 2.

It may seem like a lot of stories when you're trying to read them, but in
general we don't get that many stories; often we go for long periods of time
without _any_ stories at all.  If you're using rn, just mark the stories and
continue.  That way you can always go back and read them (unless they have
expired, but they would do that in their own newsgroup as well).

Well, Dad, I've been around here for 2 [that's 1+1] years, and I've
suffered through a number of these discussions before.  I guess I
don't quite fit (1).  As for being a selfish dweeb who's only interested
in "my game," get a clue.  Have you read a recent proposal?  The
current 3-way split with .misc, .fiction or .stories, and .references
or .resources has nothing to do with game systems.  Wake up and

As someone else pointed out in the middle on a long discourse on the subject .
  - If we got rid of this thread of discussion the group wouldn't be too
    busy!!!
Why don't we all agree not to discuss splitting the group anymore.  It would
cetainly keep everyones KILL FILE smaller since they wouldn't have to spend
all their time putting all the "SPLIT" topics into the KILL file and could go
about reading what they read the group for RPG stuff!

I don't really care if the group gets split or not since I can use KILL files
but I wish everyone would quit clogging up the net with a discussion that has
absolutly nothing to do with Role Paying Games.

Split or Don't Split but lets get back to gaming material.

Just for the record, have any of the yea-sayers considered the full
implications of a split?
I don't think the majority have. The purposed 3-way split will result in two
groups having next to zero traffic, and the r.g.frp.whatever group receiving
the same amount of traffic. The stories group will have very few postings after
a while, because nobody will read or comment on them. A ".reference" group can
be better served by indepent archivers. The postings there derserve to be
stored for a long period of time.

The other problem I have, is this "behind the backs" route that this call for
"dissection" has been carried out. It seems to me that the most ardent
supporters waited till the Xmas break to bring this up. The majority of the
people who read this group are not here to voice their opinions, and they need
to be heard. I suggest that we hold off on this discussion till after the start
of the new semester/quarter. Let's do this properly, let's do this right.

Oh, I see, you want to sort the files by subject and such a high volume
makes it inconvenient.  Are you saying that we should split the groups
because YOU are inconveniced?  I hope not, but thats the way its coming

Yeah, but I have been here over 5 years and stories always get posted in
bunches.  (speaking of which, does anyone have copies of stories that were  
post about 3 years back?).  There will be long break where none of them
get posted...  This is not a static newsgroup, the usage goes up and down
and we are at a high point right now....

just love to overgeneralize about people.  Evidently, many of them

The volume of messages in this group is small compared to other 
newsgroups, though the signal to noise ratio (when we're not 
DOING THINGS LIKE THIS) is generally pretty good.

> since I started reading this newsgroup over a year ago. 

I've wanted to ask this for a long time:  who's been reading this group 
for the longest period of time?  I've been here since 1984, but I suspect
others have been around longer (Glenn Thain, are you out there?).

This group does seem to have a larger turnover than a lot of others,
no doubt due to the connection between colleges and frp-ing.  Once
you get out into the Real World (tm), you suddenly have far less time
to do things like game or read about gaming.  This turnover is also
what no doubt sparks the recurring discussion of whether we should
split the group: a bunch of students who've been reading this group
for less than two or three years max and who have no idea what is 
involved in administering the net suddenly decide it's just too
inconvenient to them to sort through all the articles on Champions
or Traveller or copyright law or melee systems or character sheets
or stories or the often rumored but rarely seen frp software, and
so go on a Let's Split the Group Jihad.  Once we get past this, we'll
be open for a Let's Create a Net-FRP Jihad, and then a What's Wrong
With AD&D Jihad is scheduled shortly thereafter.  That ought to take
us to summer break when the traffic here drops precipitously and no
one even wonders about splitting up a good thing.

That's fine, except that the Usenet does not exist for your or anyone
else's personal convenience.  Take it as a blessing that it exists
at all, and hope that no admin either local to you or upstream from
you suddenly decides that everything non-work related will be dumped.
Believe it or not, this happens with some regularity.

It bears repeating that the GUIDELINES FOR USENET GROUP CREATION can
be found in news.announce.newusers.  That's where I got my copy.
It also bears repeating that it would be nice to have a cogent
argument from the proponents of reorganization as to WHY reorganizing
is desirable.  I'm keeping an open mind.  If I see a compelling argument
that a concensus can be built on, I'll happily vote yes.

Proponents have an uphill battle, though, since those against reorg have made
several good points:

* Drawing attention to a rec group increases the risk that the group
  will be removed.  This is not idle paranoia.  I've seen it happen.
  It's happened to me.  I didn't like it.

* Reorganization is no guarantee against unwanted traffic.  People
  will still post to the "wrong" subgroup.

* Reorganization diminishes the nicest feature of having one group:
  brainstorming, that is, people building on other peoples articles,
  spawning new and interesting threads from boring/moribund ones.

* Stories and NetBooks, and associated discussion, have never dominated
  traffic, in terms of numbers of articles.

Finally, my personal preferences.  I haven't yet seen a proposal that
divides what-I-like from what-I-don't-like, primarily because I like
most everything.  So I'd end up reading every message (or at least
skimming the Subject line) on every subgroup proposed so far.  I
therefore see no organizational benefit to me in a reorg.

I prefer to not have to worry about which subgroup to post to.  Taking
one proposal (.misc, .ref, .fiction), suppose I have a story excerpt
(.fiction) that contains interesting rules mechanics (.ref) as well as
touching on a thread about humorous spell misfires (.misc)?  Do I post
to all and then suffer the flames of "don't post this here, post it
there" from flamers who don't inspect Newsgroups lines?  Do I post to
.misc only and post pointers in the other two (additional busywork for
me, more overhead)?  Do I divide the posting up, losing valuable linkage
info, and post separately (busywork, overhead to process three
articles)?

Either: 1.  A relatively new reader of rec.games.frp brings it up again.
or      2.  Someone who brought it up earlier and didn't learn his/her
            lesson brings it up again.

The main reasons it gets shot down every time is that nobody can
come up with a good reason for a split.  Most readers of this group
are happy with browsing and using 'kill files.'  Everyone has topics
that they don't like to read.  In my case, I tend to avoid threads not
related to games that I play; however, for me to suggest that the
group be subdivided into a million game-related groups (e.g., 
rec.games.frp.AD <http://rec.games.frp.AD>&D, rec.games.frp.GURPS, etc.) would be impractical
and probably not very popular with many people.

If this "reorganization' takes place, then most readers are simply 
going to have 5 or more groups to read where they only had one previously.
What is the point?

This may the case at a .edu site, but it's a different story entirely at a
.com site; most sysops at a work place are going to think twice before adding
another 2, 3, or whatever non-scientific newgroups.  I know *I* would have a
very difficult time gaining access to any new frp groups.  I've lost access to
new groups before when another group split, and I don't want it to happen 
again.

Besides, there is currently (nor do I believe there ever will be) a clear
consensus on how to split the damn group - so why bother?
LEAVE FRP THE WAY IT IS!!

However, there are benefits to some. (like me :) I, unfortunately, do not have
the time to read rec.games.frp very often, and usually, I just scan the last 
few articles. While I'd like to read them, the bandwidth on the group is just
too high for me to get through with everything else going on. So, I think the
addition of rec.games.frp.ref and rec.games.frp.stories (or whatever they are
going to be called) is a real boon to those who do not have time to go through
the whole newsgroup. Even if people decide that rec.games.frp should remain a
catch-all, the addtion of rec.games.frp.ref and rec.games.frp.stories as a 
repositiory for those posts fitting the proper criteria, the new groups will 
still be beneficial. The split will not so much hamper collaberative creativity,
as make the products of that creativity available to more people.

PUT UP OR SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!




The "netgods" have a protocol to deal with these disagreements.

Post a CALL FOR DISCUSSION, then, after the requisite time, post a CALL
FOR VOTES.  Count the votes.  If the split wins, the issue is 
resolved.  If it doesn't the issue is still resolved.

BEGIN THE RESOLUTION PROCESS!!!

Insofar as I know, no formal call for discussion has been posted.

For those of you who superciliously demand that everyone be good little 
gamers and not scare you with talk about splitting, let your votes be 
known.  If you are in a sufficiently large minority, then the group will not
be split, and you can self-superiourly point back to the vote
whenever someone raises the question of a split.  If you really think
that the splitters are in the minority CALL FOR A VOTE YOURSELVES!  Then you 
can prove it.

The only splits I can think of that would cause people to read one
group and not the rest are along the lines of division by game system
(which we pretty much all agree is a stupid waste of time) or by genre
(which I personally feel is a stupid waste of time).

Also, by labelling the group ".gm" and ".player" I am not implying
that gm campaign secrets would be posted to the gm group.  I am
implying that those posts useful only to gms (Grasslands, Tabolport,
net.books, *source material*) and their ensuing discussions should be
posted here.

If something is of value to both player and gm (new spells, etc), it
should go to players, since, as you said, players can be gms and vice
versa.

As an aside, I am quickly shifting back toward the net.paranoid end of
the spectrum (with net.split.at.all.costs at the other end).  Mostly
because the ceaseless arguing about how stupid one or another split is
tends to get boring after a week or so.

And the endless stream of reg.games.frp.reorg/splitters/d quasi-jokes
is *really* getting on my nerves!

I think the fact that this discussion keeps coming up "with annoying regularity"
is a good indicater that a split *IS* needed.  Figuring out HOW to split it is
the hard part.

I urge people to support SOME type of split, even if it isn't the split
which you think is best.  I saw one person, for instance, say that he wouldn't
oppose one type of split, but he wouldn't support it either, although he did
support splitting the group in some fashion.  I think it would be better to
support a split that you don't agree with entirely than to hold out for the
PERFECT split.  I think most people probably would agree that an imperfect
reorg would be better than no reorg at all.

If you have a magic spell you can cast that will cause everyone who posts here
to suddenly become good at putting descriptive Subject lines in their messages,
then your solution will work.  However, it doesn't seem to be working too well
so far, and personally I doubt that you have such a mystic power.  How does
splitting the group hurt you?  What's the point in voting against it?

I am against it because it would fragment many of the discussions
across the different groups, making them hard to follow.  For example,
the recent "Best use of spells" thread could easily be posted to the
"stories" group, but technical discussion of why the spell should or
shouldn't work like that would belong in the .misc group.  Now the
thread is going on in two different groups.  I would rather be able to
follow it in one.  If we have a .ref group, would articles discussion
the reference material be put in .ref or .misc? Some poeple will think
one thing and others will think another, fragmenting the discussion.
There are only about 25 articles per day now, and splitting would only
divert about 5 of those (accourding to current statistics.) It just
isn't worth the effort and headaches for so little return.

Tuesday, 15 January 1991 23:52:47 UTC - Walter Milliken:
Having been around this group a while, I've seen a number of split
proposals come and go.  The two or three-way split between general
discussion, stories, and resource material is the first one I've seen
that actually made *some* sense.
I'd be happy to see the stories and the net.books go somewhere else --
it seems I spend half my time tinkering with my kill buffer to kill
off the latest crop.  Part of my leaning toward the split is that I
use the NNTP-based Gnews newsreader, which can be rather slow.  Very
long posts like the net.books take forever to 'n' over.  Presumably
this doesn't afflict those people who use the spool-based newsreaders
like rn, but it is a consideration for some of us.

I wouldn't read either the stories or the resources groups (no time
and/or interest), so not having to tinker the kills for each new crop
of stories and net.books or whatever would be a significant feature to
me.  I'll probably vote in favor of the split, but I'm won't be
terribly unhappy if it fails -- the traffic usually isn't all *that*
bad.

I'm strongly opposed to any of the other proposed splits -- I can't
see the utility of a gm/player split when most people are both, and
the genre or game-system splits won't work for the usual reasons
everyone gives.

Moderation of any of the groups should be avoided, though -- not only
does some poor person have to take the job, but it will stifle the
groups.  Also, I'd be perfectly happy to see all the net.book and
story requests go somewhere else.

The points against the split are:

  It unnecessarily fragments Usenet.

  It will accomplish nothing for the vast majority of rec.games.frp readers
    (since they will likely read/scan all the newly created groups).
  It will draw attention to the group, increasing the possibility
    that some SysAdmins will drop it (rec and alt groups having low
    priority at most establishments).
  It is possible that some systems will be slow to carry the new groups
    or will choose not to carry them at all; thus inconveniencing current
    readers.
  And depending on the exact nature of a split, Net bandwidth could be
    adversely affected due to cross-posting.

Yes, ``split'' and ``fragment'' are reasonably close synonyms, and we
realize that you think the split is unnecessary. What's your argument?

This is the real question. Do the vast majority of potential (not just
current) rec.games.frp readers approve of a split and/or name change?
A few years ago, when I brought up the same question, enough people
approved of a split that I almost called for a vote. I stopped when I
was told that renames were impossible---as was, for all practical
purposes, true at the time.

>   It will draw attention to the group, increasing the possibility

By that argument, no rec or alt group will ever be created. In reality,
any admin with time to manage news either doesn't mind rec.games.frp or
has already killed it.

By that argument, no new group will ever be created. Lots of things are
*possible*.

Crossposting does not affect bandwidth. The worst a crossposted article
can do is be seen twice by one reader, and most newsreaders support Xref
by now. Crossposting is often abused but not inherently evil.
