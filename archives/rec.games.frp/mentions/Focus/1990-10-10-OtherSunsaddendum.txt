TITLE: Other Suns addendum

Wednesday, 10 October 1990 15:46:33 UTC+1 - John Redden:
I have received a number of messages from people requesting:
1. Retransmission of lost or garbled messages.
2. What kind of strange order are these things being posted?

I have saved all your messages and will respond with a list of 
contents of the messages, but unfortunately not the numbers.
I have a "random" collection of OS material I pulled off Nialls
Fidonet board.  A list will be emailed to you and you can tell
me what is "missing".  Also Niall looks like he has usenet access
now.  I was doing this as a favor for him and for you but future
Other Suns material should be coming directly from him.  I am
glad to help.  Its an excellent SFRPG with a long and interesting
campaign history.

Just in case you missed it Nialls usenet address:
Nicolai...@f524.n102.z1.FIDONET.ORG <>
