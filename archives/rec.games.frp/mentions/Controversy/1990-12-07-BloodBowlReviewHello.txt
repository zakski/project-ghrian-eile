ER... How would you like to be introduced as "the male Chester H Zeshonski,
 
whose Net Spellbook is on my killfile list"?  You made two comments about 
me
in your review - first you noticed that I was female, and second that
something you attributed _incorrectly_ to me was on your killfile.  (It's
John Redden who's been posting Other Suns by installment.)  That
was IT.  Strictly speaking it may not have been fair to call you on what
was presumably pure carelessness, but if it helps you to READ what you say
before hitting SAVE, it may have been worth it.  

And for what it's worth, I responded to you as soon as I saw the message.
Remember - it takes TIME for messages to get around on this echo.
