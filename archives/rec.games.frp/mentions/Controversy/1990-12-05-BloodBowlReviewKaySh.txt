TITLE: Blood Bowl Review (Kay Shapero READ THIS) 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wednesday, 5 December 1990 17:17:12 UTC - Chester H Zeshonski:
        Ok, that does it.  I had thought that since Ms. Shapero had not yet re-
sponded to my reference (NOT read:  attack) to her, it had been understood.
        I was wrong.  But the bigger wrong was, by far, done by you, Ms. Sha-
pero.  The story as it is: 
                --For some reason, my follow-up command (we don't have Reply by
                        mail at this university) won't work properly (or I'm
                        simply not using it correctly).  I tried to get in a 
                        reply to Walter Collins' ridiculous article (mine would
                        have been first, actually).  My follow-ups always seem
                        to result in a 400-something "article contains more 
                        lines than the original" error message, or something 
                        similar.
                --In a post about the Blood Bowl review, I attempted to make a
                        display about what to do if you are not interested in a
                        particular game (ie., I wrote that your (sic) Other 
                        Suns game was on my killfile).
                --I also made a comment about not noticing that many female po-
                        sters.  This is mainly because I DON'T BOTHER TO LOOK
                        (although obvious things like Charles_K_Hughes stick 
                        out as male, as well as my own postings, and Jeff Steh-
                        man, and Kay Shapero sticks out as female; all probably
                        because of the use of last names that makes them stick
                        better in my photographic memory, for some reason) to
                        see whether a particular poster is male or female.
                --I was tired.  The comment didn't have to be made, but there 
                        was nothing inherently offensive about it.
        Now, i was very prepared for a flame war over this between myself and
whoever takes issue with me (particularly, of course, Ms. Shapero).
        I'm going to settle this right now:
                --Nowhere did I say that the Other Suns game was on my killfile
                        because Kay Shapero, the woman whose name is most 
                        closely connected with it on the net, is female.
                --Explain to me how I can rig my killfile to kill all articles 
                        written by a certain author.  My killfile has "Other
                        Suns" and "Othersuns" on it, NOT "all articles written
                        by Kay Shapero".
                --To hear you say it, I probably have some pig-headed "all ar-
                        ticles written by a female" subject-header on my kill-
                        file.  In fact, I'll bet that's why I asked if there 
                        were more women on the net.  Hell, I'll admit it.  In
                        fact, would the following people with questionable (at
                        least to me) male/female names please respond to me by
                        e-mail (Walter, take heart) so I can add your name to
                        my killfile (right next to Kay Shapero, folks!  Line
                        right up!) and ignore all your letters:
                                        --Michel
                                        --Kelwyn
                                Now, I think both of these are male posters 
                        (though i really don't care), but one can never be too
                        sure that a female won't try to sneak past my male-
                        chauvinist-pig barricade, huh?
                --"Other Suns" isn't on my killfile because you wrote it, or
                        because a male wrote it, or because I "despise" it, or
                        anything else other than the fact that I don't find it
                        relevant to me and I don't have the time to read 
                        through 15 rounds of it.
                --If I violated netiquette by mentioning that a certain sub-
                        ject was on my killfile, I am sorry.  However, I doubt
                        that I have.  If you are offended that someone out
                        there in netland has your (sic) game on his/her kill-
                        file (would it be ok for me to do so if I were female,
                        Ms. Shapero?), that is not my problem.  I am reasona-
                        bly sure that out there more than one person has
                        "Blood Bowl" on their killfile.  Their reasons do not
                        concern me.  And if it happens to be because *I* am 
                        writing the articles, then that person is a narrow-
                        minded fool, as I would be if I deleted all articles 
                        by any one specific person.  However, I was deleting
                        articles on THE GAME, NOT THE PERSON.

        I would have e-mailed you with this except that you attacked my inte-
grity on the net, and thus I am posting this to the net itself.
        I think it is a waste of time that I have to respond to unfounded mud-
slinging like this when I'm trying to finish my story and get another review
posted.
        And go ahead, if it will make you feel better, and tell me that you
have both "The Lords of Midnight" and "Blood Bowl" on your killfiles...I can
accept that.  Or, if you don't, go right ahead and put them on out of spite,
and that way your allegations will at least apply to one person on the net--
you yourself.  Because, speaking for myself, they apply to no one on the net
as I see it.
        Notice the decided lack of smileys.
        It's quite intentional.
        I am not amused.

Hi all.  I'm going to relocate to the North Denver/Boulder area
shortly and am looking for gaming groups in the area.  I'm really
flexible about system/period, etc.  Please reply be email.  Thanks.

What a twit. "Violated my integrity on the net"
Sigh. Ever notice how anal retentive people seem on the net?

Actually, I hadn't noticed it until I read this. 
>-The Insufferable Will
"Insufferable" // "anal retentive"--need I say more?
And if Ms. Shapero won't respond, I see no reason for *you* to.  Just because I
        use words that are more than three syllables long, doesn't mean you
        should respond with such *intelligent* replies ("twit"--boy, I'm im-
        pressed...).
        I find it offensive that someone would suggest that I am sexist because
I have a certain game on my killfile that has a woman's name most closely con-
nected with it.  Maybe this wouldn't bother such an insufferable individual as
yourself, but if people would fight sexism where it exists rather than where
they *imagine* it to exist (for their own benefit, mostly), the world would be
safe from the insufferable (not the insufferable like you, however).
