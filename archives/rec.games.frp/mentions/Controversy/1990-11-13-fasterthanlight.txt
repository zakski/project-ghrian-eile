How about this.  You hit the speed of light and now have an infinite
mass relative to an outside observer (check of those Lorentz equations).
Thus, those observers have an infinite mass relative to you.

From the gravatational equation you will be attracted to that observer
with an infinite force.  You will swerve into oncoming traffic and
die in a hideous nuclear explosion of infinite kinetic energy 
(conservation of energy).  An explosion of infinite energy will 
destroy the entire universe and we will all be dead, because of one
jerk who decided to take his Porsche a little too fast.

What do you mean that the inability to exceed the speed of light
is a myth?  It's a pretty damn good idea and I know a lot of
physicists who would argue with you.

>(STuff about mass and energy approaching lightspeed)
Relativity is a lot weirder than most people realize. For example, two
people going near light speed away or towards each other. Each one will
observe the other ship's time frame as slower. (ie- to each ship, the
other ship's time rate is slower)
Also, consider the same ships, and one of them shooting photons in the
same direction as his velocity... the light will still be going light
speed to him and to the other person. (Which isn't the strangest of the
details)

Anyway, most ideas about FTL travel involve somehow warping or altering
this barrier. There is also the possibility for quantum and other
effects (another confusing science), as it has been observed that some
phenomena are instantaneous, implying that some effects CAN travel
faster than light. (Again, these are quantum effects)

The universe is a lot stranger than most people think, and there's a LOT
we don't know.

I would just like to point out that all of this is based on our current
understanding of the universe.  Can you say that every single assumption that
this is based on is 100% true.  Caution, this means that there are no theories
at all allowed because they are not 100% true because they can't be proved.

Another nasty:  no matter how fast you are going , relative to whatever, 
light always seems to be "moving" at 'c' away from you.  it's a bizzare
property of how we measure light to be moving.  Don't ask me for more
details.. go look it up in a physics book.  I took it two years ago.

(*Sigh*) Be careful, don't let the mathematical proof become absoulute
truth.  A hundred years or so ago, they had valid mathematical proofs
to show that any object that tried to pass through the sound barrier
would be shredded to bits (regardless of material strength).  We now
know these to have been "wrong" (superceded by newer knowledge).  In
time, Einstein too will be "wrong", and a more inclusive set of
knowledge will exist.

But at/close-to the 'speed of light' space does strange things, not to
mention time, and gravity travels in waves moving at the speed of light...
etc, etc, etc.  speed-of-light travel is wierd enough, but there's a whole
bunch of other wierdness that comes into play as well. I think it's just a 
sign that at high speeds, the current model breaks down.  however, untill
we can reach those speeds with more than just little bitty pieces of matter, 
we'll never know enough to fix the models.

>(nonsense about faster than light difficulties being a myth deleted)
Problems:
If you consider your mass zero, that means you are assuming that you are
still and the universe is moving around you. Thus, what you are
accelerating is the universe.
However, as speed increases, the energy needed to accelerate increase,
and this is an asymptote. (for the less knowlegable, an asymptote is a
line which is approached but never reached)
ie- as speed goes to light speed, energy required to accelerate becomes
infinite.
ie ie- You can't get theah from heah.

If you consider yourself moving and the universe still, problem applies
to SHIP.

The problem is, is that the laws of physics back then did not have as one
of the founding premises "Nothing shall go faster than the speed of sound".
SR has as one of the founding principles that c is the barrier for speed.
(there are numerous ways to form the axioms of SR, this is one of them)

Also you have to be careful about stating that previous laws are "wrong".
Predictions have been totally disproven. Any new theory would have to
include SR at some level, with all of the data that has been observed for
SR, which includes the absoluteness of the speed of light under all current
observations.

Problem is, its impossible to do FTL without also causing time travel. When
you allow time travel, you open a huge can of worms which makes it rather
difficult to do physics. Physics right now works on the principle that only
the past and present affect the state of the system (and the past only if its
within the past light cone) and that the future states of the system don't
matter. With causality gone, you really have problems....

So?  The methods of "faster than light" travel in most frpg's
are done in such a way as to not violate this principle.  Even
in Star Trek, the faster than light speeds are obtained by warping
the time-space continuum in such a way that you actually travel
faster on a universal scale while still traveling slower on a 
local scale---it's the universe that has, however, changed shape
to allow this.  There are also theories of hyperspace, etc..
that also work in similar contexts, only you're travelling outside
of "normal" space.

Besides, these are FANTASY roll-playing games.  So who really
bloody cares?  Maybe you should check out which newsgroup this
is...  In the realm of fantasy, anything is possible.

concerning FTL travel;  if it took your FTL craft months (or even years) of
"objective" time (rather than subjective time, which I suppose would be
shorter) to reach c, wouldn't it be possible (assuming that the math could
be worked out) to arrive on target a few "objective" minutes after you left
your point of departure, rather than before you left?
This would require that you be able to gauge the rate at which you are
"moving backwards in time", of course, but it would allow you to avoid time
travel in the colloquial sense.  Still, I suppose that it wouldn't solve the
problem on the atomic level...

        Interesting theory.  Let's see your evidence:

>You may seem to become more massive to someone observing you
>from earth, but your mass will seem normal to you.
        Good so far, but don't forget about time dialation and length 
contraction.  Of course, the same applies and you still seem normal to you.


>At the speed of light you will seem to be infinitely massive to
>the observer, if you actually exist at all to him.
        Here's  a problem.  You cannot reach the speed of light.  As you get
closer and closer to c, it requires more and more energy to accelerate you.
Here's a little table showing the amount of energy required (as % of rest mass)
to attain a certain velocity:

                Speed (c)        Energy (% of rest mass)
                ---------        -----------------------
                   .1c                          0.5 %
                   .5                          1.4        
                   .9                         92.9
                   .99                        347.4
                   .999                        1116.
                   .9999                3535.

        (These values were generated by applying a relativistic modifier to
        the equation E = .5mv^2.  Resulting in  E = .5m(1/SQRT(1-v^2/c^2)v^2)

        As v approaches c, the amount of energy required for any delta v
approaches infinity.  Therefore, since you cannot have an infinite amount of
energy, you cannot achieve lightspeed by a kinematic approach.  Since you 
cannot achieve lightspeed itself this way, you cannot *exceed* it this way
either.  Oh well.



>At speeds above the speed of light, your mass will seem to 
>have an imaginary vector, again *if* you can be said to exist
>in this universe. If you continue to accelerate, your mass will
>begin to approach zero.
        Except for a few applications in electronics, the value of the square
root of a negative value is undefined.  The Lorentz transforms are not valid 
when v>c because imaginary numbers are irrelevant in kinematics.  These
equations are simply not designed to handle cases where v>=c.  This is like
Newton's equations of gravity and motion were not designed to handle any
relativistic cases.

I would bet it wasn't a case of "new knowledge," but more likely somebody forgot

Any FTL trip has at least one reference frame from which it can be
viewed as a time-trip.  What do you mean by "objective"?  Relative to
the target, the origin, or the almighty ether?

The problem is that time-travel violates the laws of cause and effect.
So, if FTL travel exists (according to current theories), causality
does not.  Even if no one actually uses FTL to travel in time,
there's still the problem that the laws of science take a vacation

Solving time paradoxes by assuming people are nice and try not to cause
them is not good logic. The point is, if time travel exists it CAN cause
problems, and, as a basic rule, paradoxes don't exist in nature.
(Of course, perhaps they DO, or perhaps they're only paradoxes to US.
Quantum physics comes to mind)

Which reminds me of a race in one of my 'future histories' (subrace of
human): the Physics. Basically, physicists 2000+ years in the future
whose knowledge is so esoteric and advanced that they are a mystery to
all other humans, and who form religious-like groups. They also have
enormous power, because due to their knowledge of the universe they can
do a lot of things that appear impossible to others. Unfortunately, it's
impossible to explain to others how they did so.

Sample:
"How'd you blow that door down with that pencil???"
"I didn't. It imploded when I aimed a grijjnin fluxrotor at it."
"Oh, that's a grijjnin fluxrotor then, is it?"
"No, now it's a pencil."
"WHAT??"
"Uncertainty fluxed in hyperspatial endograms, you see, so the cohesive
energy of the door was routed... <bla bla bla>"

it was a matter of using equations that were not valid for a mach number near one.
(there was division by 1 - M^2)  the tragic part about this is that some people
were arguing for the existence of the sound barrier long after it was known that
bullets can travel supersonically.

I'd be careful how you categorize everythig.  If by fantasy, you mean
somehting that is not necessarily real, I agree whole-heartedly.

If you mean the genere of fantasy (Pseudo medevil with magic) it has
no bearing to the discussion.

The major gripe I see is someone who wishes to live entirely within
the 'real' universe (so far as we know it) and thus denies the
possibility of FTL travel.  This would mean that we are limited to a
single stellar system (not necessarily Sol) and travel within it is
long and tedious.  I am not saying that playing in such a setting is
boring, I've been working on a "Sol only" campaign for a few years
(it's on the back burner).  However to criticize SF RPGs for exceeding
the light barrier is like criticizing Fantasy RPGs for using magic,
which we know is not possible. ;-)

Thursday, 15 November 1990 14:35:08 UTC - Rick Novy:
I'm a b.s. physics/math, with some graduate physics under my belt also. 
 I already spoke my piece, though.
 
As for photons emitted from someone travelling at say .9c, yes light 
certainly is travelling at c to EVERYONE, but to our traveller, not 
only is he seeing light travelling at c, but he also sees himself travelling 
at .9c.  Keep that in mind. What kind of strange effects that will 
have?  Red and blue shifting most everything into gamma or transmission 
line frequencies, depending upon relative direction.  It's not as simple 
as just how fast am I going, what is my mass, there are other effects 
also. Accelerating to infinite mass takes infinite energy.  Space is 
not a vacuum, there are particles there.  You have friction which will 
cause you to burn up when you go fast enough, same as a rock falling 
into the atmosphere.
Keep in mind also when you talk Special Relativity, which is the only 
thing mentioned here so far, that you can't be accelerating. period. 
 When you accelerate, you move on to General relativity, which is much 
much more complicated.  Remember that a turn at constant speed is still 
considered an acceleration, so the twin paradox is NOT a problem of 
special relativity.  Every mention of relativity has assumed special 
relativity when you are ALL assuming the same rules hold for acceleration.
Remember, Special relativity is a small derivable subset of General 
relativity, much as Newtonian mechanics is a small derivable subset 
of Special, hence General relativity.  I spent 6 years studying physics, 
and I know next to nothing about it.  Ask a PhD in physics, and he 
will claim to know next to nothing about it also.  It is one of those 
things that the more you know, the less you know, as it were.  You 
can't possibly ex[pect to have valid arguements from a general physics 
book from the 1 semester you may have had as an undergrad.
I guess the point I am again trying to deliver is that you can't go 
around making blanket statements without the facts to back them up, 
and that's been going on lately, and that's why I've been keeping most 
of my comments on FTL travel to myself, because i realize that fiction 
and fact HAVE to part sometimes, and if you try to be too technical, 
you don't have any playability.  Well, I have rambled enough, so I'm 
going to go back  to passive observer for awhile unless anyone has 
anything to direct to me.

Oh REALLY? Explain, well, why two observers will each observe the other
(if they are travelling at different speeds) having a slower time rate.
Or why if you accelerate away and back, time has been cumulatively less
for you, despite the above...

Or what happens if you accelerate from something near light, then
something else accelerates from you (at apparent rest) to near light...

As I understand it, science HAS NO LAWS.  There are theories that work
very well and very consistently, and which may very well be applicable
throughout the universe and in all situations.  We can never know this,
though; you cannot proove that a scientific theory is correct - only
that it is not incorrect.  The first "incorrect" result that your theory
turns up blows it to hell, and you have to start formulating a new
theory that takes the "incorrect" result into account...  It is quite
possible that what we regard as a "law" today may actually only be
manifestations or implications of a larger, more complicated and
comprehensive theory or set of theories.

So FTL is not neccesarily impossible.  With what we know today - with
our theoretical model of the universe and the way it works - yes,
practical FTL travel is impossible.  To say that it will always be
impossible is not a scientific fact, but a denial of the basic curiosity
and inventiveness of mankind.

Hmmm... I thought I should respond to this one.  Issue by issue,

1.)  Science has no laws.  The argument goes as follows.  Every
now and then Science formulates laws  but new facts mean the laws
have to thrown out.  Well this isn't quite accurate.  Just because
Einstein came along doesn't mean Newton was "wrong" so much as incomplete.
Most practical physics (not done on the subatomic level) still uses
Newtonian physics.  So the laws are not thrown out but instead they
are shown to not cover every situation.

2.)  Along with this claim is the corollary that FTL may someday
be found (human ingenuity is to never be questioned goes the
argument).  However what the original poster was saying wasn't
that FTL couldn't be found but if were to be found it would have
drastic effects on our view of the universe, that going faster
than light is equivalent to traveling in time. (This is because
what you think "the time right now" is 100 light years away is
dependent on how fast you're traveling, so FTL travel
will take you to a different time depending on what velocity
reference frame you are in.)  Modern physics sees time as just
another dimension and if you break one you break them all.
Now you could presupose that scientists have gotten it all wrong,
but then you would have to explain the following.

     Why do photons exist? (current theory, 0 mass but speed of
light means infinite mass, so 0 mass particle at infinite speed
yields in the limit process a finite mass.)  Why do they have
all the strange properties they do (radio waves, normal vision,
X-rays, and so on)?  Revoke relativity and you'll stop your
stereo from working (it is based on semiconductor chips that
have electrons do quantum tunneling).  And chemistry will
have to get a reworking as well(Why do electrons like to
fill up to their valence number around an atom).

     Why do magnetic fields exist? (electromagnectic charges
send particles to communicate attraction and repelling, such
particles "fall behind" when electrons go close to speed of
light and create magnetic fields).  The speed of light is
a fundamental constant in the Maxwell equations describing
relationship between electromagnetism and magnetic fields.

Well, this is FRP group and I'm putting too much science in to this.
But I'm of the personal opinion that FTL will never be found (and
maybe explains why we're not being over run by aliens from far away
stars) and to explain why it is necessary for me to explain why
Relativity won't go the way of the Aristotlean model of the solar
system.  In the old days to contradict one fact in one branch of
"science" (they really didn't do science back then, more like
philosophical tall tales) would have no effect on any other, today to
contradict one fact is to make the whole structure fall apart.  To
presuppose FTL is equivalent (to me) to presupposing the moon is
really made of green cheese.

                       -Sam

P.S.  In my Sci-Fi world I use FTL, as science it is bad, but as
a plot device it is wonderful.

There is also a Sol-only GURPS Space sourcebook in the works at SJG. They

"Terradyne", and it gives a future history out to about 2120. It mentions
FTL experiments, but there are no existing FTL ships. Mars is being
Terraformed by a giant moon-based corporation called "Terradyne", under
the watchful eyes of UPOE - a reasonably powerful world government.

Ok, as you move close to the speed of light your mass increases.
And so it takes more energy to accelerate.
But what if you are useing a mass conversion to energy scheme as fuel?
Then you can use that extra mass to accelerate that extra mass.
     
Now, as you get very close to the speed of light the uncertainty 
principle comes into play. Since there is a delta of uncertainty in any

Actually, Matt, the problem is in trying to extend equations from

Just because Einstein's special relativity equations break down in
the supraluminal regime ("imaginary" numbers) doesn't mean that

        On an unrelated note, wouldn't it be nice if people making

Sorry, photons have zero rest mass.  Therefore, since their mass is
infinitely increased by travelling at light-speed (pardon me for
sloppy phrasing), their energy is not determined by these formulas.

Because it keeps bouncing off oxygen molecules and therefore can't quite

What extra mass?

Basically, given a totally efficient method of converting mass to
thrust, you can maintain a constant mass, balancing gain of mass
due to speed with loss of rest mass.

Remember that, from your point of view, you are moving normally, while
the universe is doing funny things.  You don't see any extra mass in
yourself.

Velocity is one component of momentum, mass is another.  Therefore,
if there is uncertainty in momentum (and how much in a macroscopic
body - uncertainty effects are usually insignificant in bodies of
larger than molecular size) it will not noticeably affect measured
velocity.  You won't break lightspeed unless your delta-momentum
plus your "real" momentum at least reaches infinity....

ways that do not involve physics.

Ah, but one important note about quantum simultaineity (SP??) is that
there is no theoretical way someone could influence the events.

ie- The events will be random, although they WILL be simultaneous. Has
interesting repercussions on cosmology, becuase quantum forces do
trickle up and affect macro forces. (a la' chaos theory....)

This is what happens when science is only partially explained to people.
(Not insulting you...)

The extra mass is kinetic energy. Energy becomes mass (and vice versa),
they are equivalent (in a bizarre way). Thus, if you turn the mass back
to energy, you are, in a sense, decellerating the ship, then
accelerating it again. In other words, no, you can't.

This is a CUTE idea! I love it! Unfortunately, consider the following: 

Large (massive?) objects have very small uncertain
momentum/velocity/whatever. A space craft would have LITTLE uncertainty
of momentum!

Also, quantum tunneling is usually with ENERGY barriers. ie- if it takes
10 nanojoules to cross something, and the particle is hovering around 9,
there is a chance the particle will tunnel.

However, macroscopic objects don't do this. Also, the energy barrier
represented by the speed of light is infinite. You don't tunnel through
that.

Now, IF tachyons exist (which means that speeds OVER the speed of light
are possible, you just can't get there normally), and IF particles can
tunnel through that barrier (given the first IF), and IF one can cause
particle-level quantum effects extraordinarily large, then it's possible.

(Problem 1, of many: Tachyons are theoretical particles whose lowest
speed is light speed. Unfortunately, as I seem to recall, their REST
velocity (ie- zero for a normal particle) is infinite. This seems rather
silly. Anyone care to clarify????)

Photons do not have mass.  They do have energy and momentum.  More
generally, E can be expressed as:

E = (m^2 c^4 + p^2 c^2)^(1/2)

Photons have zero mass, so E = pc.  For matter at rest (i.e. zero velocity
and momentum) the formula then reduces to the familiar E = mc^2.

Error- special relativity equations are useful just BECAUSE they predict
things accurately at CLOSE TO LIGHT SPEED. This barrier is not something
that was a byproduct, but a systemic observation that the universe has
light speed as a barrier. GIVEN that, a lot of observations make sense.
If you disregard this, a lot of observations seize to make sense.

Now, GRANTED, at some future time we may discover some extra complex
version of the above theory. However, in normal space relativity holds
as far as we can perceive. Any special cases will either occur with
undiscovered or little understood particles or under very strange
circumstances.

Different materials have different permativites (sp.) and permeabilities
that govern how electromagnetic radiation travels through them.  The speed of
light in any material is equal to 

        v = 1 / square root (permativity * permeability) 

So if you know the permativity and permiability of the material, you know how 
fast light travels through the material.

Strictly speaking, it is a consequence of special relativity that massed
objects cannot be accelerated to lightspeed.  The math is relatively
straightforward, so if accelerate to lightspeed is possible, then at least
one of the assumptions of special relativity must be incorrect.  A
conventional derivation of special relativity has only two postulates:
  1. The laws of physics are the same for observers in all inertial reference
     frames.  No frame is singled out or preferred.
  2. The speed of light in free space has the same value c in all directions
     and in all inertial reference frames.
This derivation was given before the advent of quantum mechanics.  However,
one of the guiding principles of quantum mechanics is that the quantum
equations should have limits which approach the classical (i.e. macroscopic
scale) equations.  All the "real" QM-based time-travel proposals that I've
seen require the construction of, in effect, warp gates, not FTL drives.
A rationale for FTL which tries to be too "realistic" is bound to run into
difficulties.

if light has momentum, and can be affected by gravity, then it might as

Sorry, I should have clarified.  Photons have no rest mass.  The m in the
equation I gave is rest mass.  Mass...energy...what's the difference?  ;)

Mass does not increase as you move faster.  What does increase is the
term "gamma" (1/(1-(v/c)^2)^1/2.

Since mass doesn't increase, this won't work.  Furthermore, even if it
did, it hasn't in your reference frame, so you can't use it.

No.  As your error in measurement of mass and momentum get very small,
then uncertanty principle comes into play.  The uncertanty principle
arrises from momentum and postition space being Fourrier trasnforms of
each other.  This means that the error in the position measurement
time the error in measurement in momentum has to be greater than some
constant. This constatn is called h (or h-bar if you divide it by
2*pi) and it is very small (~ 10^-24 meter^2/sec, give or take a few
orders of magnitude).  So, uncertantiy come into play when you get out
to around the 12 decimal place in presision in both momentum and
position.  This has very little to do with travvelling near the speed
of light.

In science you have to be VERY careful how you say something.  In essence a
photon has a non zero effective mass, but most assuredly has a zero rest mass.
It is generally taken as best practice to say it has no mass, only energy, and
that the energy's effective mass is worked upon by gravity and such.

Since I'm here, might as well add my $.02.  I haven't seen anything workable
for an actual ftl drive system, but...(ooo my modern physics teacher hated me
for this one)...there is a possibility for generating effective motion faster
than that of light.  By use of a "worm hole".  At Balticon last year, they had
a physicist there telling of his idea to make these things work.  Whether
he's right or not, I have no clue (I'm just a stupid EE major--what do I know)
but If it does, you still get back to the causality problem.  At least
according to him you do.  I don't know personally, but he also suggested a way
of using these holes as pseudo time machines by moving one end of it close to
the speed of light, then bringing it back to the other end.  There would
supposedly be a time shift when stepping into one and out the other (relative
to observers standing watching).  Very interesting and very annoying as well.
Have fun with this one guys.

The force of gravity doesn't travel faster than light (sais Einstein).
Therefor this infinite force can not reach you and you will travel forever
(at  least so it seams to an outside observer, to you time will stop,
meaning the universe(s) will hurry by and by from bigbang to bigbang.)

The Myons, which "live" for (Sekundenbruchteile) little parts of one second,
are produced in the upper parts of the atmosphere, and travel with nearly
lightspeed for ten or more times their "livetime" down to surface, where
they can be detected/sensored before they change/fall apart.

So this would be makeable, allthough the mass of a myon is *very* small,
compared with a human.

No, much simpler.  I found that I worked harder for the advanced
quantum theory course than for any course before (and, as it happened,
any course or project thereafter in school -- up to and including
my PhD orals).  And I barely managed to squeek by with a B+.  This
told me something -- that physics was no longer easy for me, and at
a time when (as an undergraduate) I was breezing through graduate
courses in mathematics (NOT survey courses, mind you) I should
seriously consider changing my major...

What extra mass???
The mass-to-energy converter will work in the spaceships inertialsystem and
will NOT know of any extra mass!!!!!
It is only ONE way to look at it, when you say the the mass of an object 
increases when as the systems velocity increases towards c.
Actually it all falls out of the Lorenz transformations, and they only
discuss time and space!!!
So, another way of looking at it is to say, that the 'increased mass' is
an imaginary effect caused by the time/space delution, wich is 'real'.
What is true is hard to say, but one thing's for sure:
        The engine will not have more mass to convert.

It could be fun to calculate the consequences of your idea, though. :-)

Nope!
The formula to calculate the energy of a photon is: E=hv, where v is the 
frequenz (Hz) of the light and h is Plancks constant.
The M in your formula is the relativistic mass: M=Mo/(1-v/c).
v: the velocity, Mo: the resting mass. That cannot be calculated for photons
(what is 0/(1-c/c)????), instead speed, wavelength and momentum are related
through Plancks constant!
All this means that a photon has finite momentum (no big explosion (sorry))
and besides photons don't collide with neucleons in the Newtonian sense, 
they are rather 'absorbed'.....but thats a long story...ask Heisenberg, he
should know :)

Okay, I was trying to avoid discussions of causality in General Relativity,
and just look at commutation of operators. (essentially, how do measurements
at different places and times interact with each other) When you look at
General Relativity for causality, then things get extremely complicated. There
aren't any discussions on causality in GR that I'd recommend for the casual
reader. Wald does a nice discussion, but you need physics at the grad level
and a heavy amount of undergrad math to understand it.

The problem comes because locally the metric looks like SR, but globally the
features can get extremely strange. GR will allow you to define nasty metrics
as valid solutions, but the question is do they have physical significance.

the current mass as rest mass) is moving at .5c with respect to it's
initial inertial frame of reference before acceleration. Now in the ships
current inertial frame of reference, we accelerate to .5c using 1.4% of
our rest mass. Now we are traveling at c with respect to the initial frame
and at .5c with the second inertial frame. We coast again and then
accelerate once more. Now we are at 1.5c with respect to the original
inertial reference frame. We could continue, but this already demonstrates
the fallacy of purporting real effects to relativistic equations...

No, your statement is in error.  In one frame of reference, two events
separated by a distance are simultaneous.  In another, one is earlier and
one is later.  If you have FTL, you can travel from the location of the
second to the location of the first in the first frame, and then travel from
the location of the first to the second in the second frame, and end up back
before you left.

Your statement is in error. In a physics sense, FTL travel over a positive
time interval in one frame will be the equivalent of FTL over a negative
time interval in another frame.

Assuming a ship travels distance x in time t, where x^2 - t^2 > 0, a
spacelike interval (in the conventient physics coordinates where c=1)
it is possible to do a Lorentz transform that takes x -> x, and t -> -t
so that an observer will see that an FTL ship has arrived at its new
destination before it left on its trip. In fact, the exact velocity
required for the transform is:

v = 2xt/(x^2 + t^2)

It is exactly analogous to doing a Lortenz transform that takes t -> t
and x -> -x for a timelike vector. (which incidentally is the same velocity
with a negative sign out in front)

Are you tired of going away for the weekend and coming home to 80 more
redundant personal letters between FRP'ers?  Are you a "traditional" gamer
who couldn't care less about lasers or 3-D Combat or Cyberpunk?  Are you as
tired as I am of the majority of posters including other people's
signatures or quoting someone who quoted someone else who quoted someone
else before that?  Or of hearing the Shapero's brag about their OTHER SUNS
game?  
Well, I am.  And more than that, but I promised myself I'd keep this as
brief as possible.

First, I will give an example of the junk I'm talking about (this is

certainly not the worst case, only the one that broke the net-reader's
back), and then I have some constructive suggestions that I think can
drastically improve this board.

Then, the replier goes into a rocket physics explanation of why the critic
was an utter boob to defame his name in public.
** End of Example **********************************************************

Problem 1:  If the subject matter is interesting to me, I will have already
        read the article(s) being quoted and re-quoted.  A brief synopsis
        of the intricacies is more than appropriate.
Problem 2:  Why is EITHER of these articles coming over the net anyway?
        E-mail is certainly called for.
Problem 3:  I'm tired of having to page over "RE: 3-D Combat" articles.
        Most of my net-time (like now, for instance) is spent on a 1200
        baud modem dial-in.  It takes TIME just to scroll over the HEADERS!
Suggestions:

1.  If I am way off base, mail me.  If you agree, mail me.  I'll gladly
post a gawdy retraction if it turns out that people like reading unfiltered
trash.  I'll post the results in a few weeks in any case.
2.  Don't write ANY MORE followups to "3-D Combat" (there are already
several hundred), "Things you never want to see in RPG's", "Fiend Folio",
"The best SCI-FI game system", or "Faster than light".
3.  Again, use EMAIL whenever possible.  It's almost always appropriate.
4.  I have given this suggestion some amount of thought.  Perhaps there
should be alternate groups for some of this stuff to be put into.  Like
these: 
        a. talk.games.frp - For all of you gossiphounds out there who just 
                have to get your personal opinions on the net.  Also, a 
                good proving ground for ideas about what to post to the
                other groups below.
        b. rec.games.frp.tech - For Cyberpunkers, GURPSers of many sorts, 
                and all sorts of techno-role-players.  This is a distinct
                category.  The language is completely different.
        c. rec.games.frp.sources - For new spells, game system postings,
                in FINISHED form.
        d. rec.games.frp.stories - For adventure ideas, scenarios.  I would
                definitely subscribe to this one.

I don't think it is unfair to leave rec.games.frp for the "Swords &
Sorcery" crowd.  That's where FRP began, anyway.
And that's where I will end my diatribe.  Thanks to those of you who made

it through.  I'm sure you're all used to skipping the longer articles (like
I am).  This is not usually the best place to find constructive networking.

Sorry to say this, friend, but you lose. Why don't you just create a group
called 'rec.games.frp.what_I_like'?

Use a KILL file. If you can't, get your sysop to install a better newsreader.

        Right, it *is* a relativitic effect, and I kudged the equations to 
give a rough feel for how it would appear from the initial reference point.
My propulsion model is a huge solar-type sailship being pushed by a perfect,
non-dispersing laser beam from its point of launch.  This eliminated the need
to carry fuel and allowed the ship to acquire energies far greater than even
its mass.

        That isn't even possible with pure matter-energy conversion *and*
a propulsor that wasted no matter or energy.  From the simple kinematic
equation E = .5mc^2, velocity is proportional to THE SQUARE ROOT of the 
energy.  To accelerate a body by .014m from rest in a reference frame 
requires
                v = SQRT(2E/m)  where E = .014mc^2
                  = SQRT(2(.014mc^2)/m)
                  = SQRT(.028c)
                  = .17c

        This itself makes several bad assumptions (but necessary to avoid
unwanted calculus) and for sanity's sake we should consider the energy source
external to the spacecraft.  Otherwise we have to worry about energy lost in
accelerating the fuel itself, etc.

        Mixing the relativistic modifier, gamma, with straight kinematics is
technically incorrect but gives a "feel" for it.  The .014m concept exceeds
the bounds of Newton's kinematics, let alone relativity.  Also, avoid mixing
the terms relativity and acceleration; it summons the demon "General Relativity"
and that is territory well beyond me or this topic.

        Actually, you (on the spacecraft) would see something more like this
after four iterations:

Reference Frame (t)                        0        1        2        3        Ship
Apparent delta v R(x) - R(x-1)                        .063c        .125c        .25c        .5c        
Apparent delta v R(3) - R(x)                .938c        .875c        .75c        .5c        rest

        (These aren't "accurate" numbers but show the trend of the inverse
square nature of it.)

Actually, it doesn't belong on sci.physics.  I thought I'd throw out
a few last points before shutting up for good.

1.  A Lorentz transformation describes the differences in time
flow, mass, and length while travelling at high sublight speeds.
Those of you running sublight SF games might want to use it
to calculate how much ship time is involved in a certain trip.
The rest of you can disregard it.

2.  To the person who suggested boosting to .5c, then to .5c relative
to that, then to .5c relative to that, you will not come out going
at 1.5c relative to your original.  Velocities don't add like that.

3.  To those who are doubting special relativity:  The appropriate
equations were derived based on the results of low-speed experiments.
The equations have been confirmed for sub-atomic particles, and are
intertwined in the design of particle accelerators.

4.  To all of you who take potshots at relativity, learn something
about it first.  There are a lot of "Relativity for the Idiot" type
books out there, pick one and read it.  Relativity, like all other
scientific theories, is likely to be superseded sometime.  It
won't be by someone who doesn't know anything about it.

5.  Relativity tells us it is not possible to transmit matter
or information faster than light.  No technique based on
relativistic or Newtonian physics is going to succeed.  It
will, further, require a conceptual leap at least as big
as that which produced relativity.  (Relativity isn't just
a bunch of equations, it's a way of thinking and observing.)

6.  (corollary to 5)  I am not going to say that FTL travel is
impossible, because I don't understand the universe that well.
I think it unlikely, but that is another matter.  However, if
FTL is possible, I don't know how it will be accomplished and
neither do you.

  Actually, since I don't play anything except AD&D (my loss, unfortunately)
I couldn't care less about most of the stuff posted to the net.  Of course,
I still read what interests me (most of the stories, AD&D stuff except
stupid arguments about what is wrong with it, lasers, some cyberpunk stuff,

  Yeah, and I'm sick and tired of all those GURPIES saying how great their
game is, the FHers who say the game is gods gift to the masses, the
ADDers who point out they were the first, the people who go on and on and
on about some meaningful point, the twits who argue whether tomatoes
should get a saving throw if they fall 10 feet (they shouldn't, a 10 foot
fall won't hurt nothing...of course, if there is a sudden stop...) and
all the related clap trap.
  Oh, yeah, and if you believe that, I have a piece of prime beachfront
property for sale, cheap.  (Of course, it is on the water side of the beach
but that shouldn't be much of an inconvenience. :)

  And, supposing you only read .frp (unlikely, at best) you'll recall ever
detail about the entire preceeding discussion?  Even reading some of the
longer discussions straight through I have a hard time remembering the 
original article.

  The ftl discussion *PERHAPS* got out of hand, however, you should have
hit "n" or simply made a kill file that included "ftl" in it.

  No.  You posted publicly about something that concerns the net at large.
Public responses are in order.  Also, implying that all discussions are 
"unfiltered trash" is a rather insulting statement.

  Why?  If you want to censor yourself, go ahead, feel free, the rest of the
net won't mind one bit.  Or are you proposing that .frp is actually
.ad&d or .fantasy_only_no_SF_&_nothing_that_Walter_thinks_is_not_real_
fantasy?

>3.  Again, use EMAIL whenever possible.  It's almost always appropriate.

  No it isn't.  I *LIKE* to read the discussions, and if someone puts forth
a statement and then everyone emails their opinions on that statement, the
original poster gets lots of mail which he may or may not summarize to the
net, and which, if he does summarize, may or may not be a fair summary.
I suspect that in your summary, of this discussion, assuming it happened
in email, you would have posted "there was one twit, but most of the
rest of the people who sent email agreed with me."

Collins:
I was under the impression that ".frp" meant "fantasy role-playing". 
Now, typically, fantasy implies sword-and-sorcery, but technically it
means any imaginative, outside reality (personal or cultural) scenario. 
Therefore, ALL the stuff posted here is fantasy.

I understand your frustration with having to sift through all the
messages you don't like.  I'm not a heavy-duty gamer, so I skip all the
posts on Champions, GURPS, Shadowrun, and others. (I've played only a
little AD&D, some Rolemaster, and some Warhammer.)  I'm not interested
in GMing, so I skip a lot of posts on rules, and I'm not a scientist, so
I skip a lot of the space posts, which often get technical.

So why am I subscibed?  Because the board is so versitile and has such a
variety of stuff that even when I do skip all the aforementioned posts,
I still have enough to read and keep me amused!

I'm not trying to be rude to you.  If you're exclusively into
sword-and-socery roleplay and want a board dealing exclusively with
that, then I suggest you simply start a new bboard called something like
"netnews.rec.games.sword-n-sorcery.frp".

The age of AD&D being the only fantasy role-playing game out there is
over.  There are a lot of other games out there now, and I think they
all deserve discussion.

I agree 100%!!!  I could understand if this was rec.games.RP... but it's
FRP... "FANTASY role-playing"... I'd like to see a seperation of the Fantasy
stuff and the Techno stuff.  It's two totally different worlds.  If you wanted
to post something that concerned both, then just post to both groups.

As far as KILL files go, system managers have better things to do, guys...
I should know... :-)

Since all of the followups to this article have been negative (which is not
surprising since all of the positive ones used e-mail, which is more
appropriate) I'd like to assure the readers that not everyone disagrees
with Walter.

If you feel that because a posting that ticks you off was public your reply 
has to be public too, ask your sysop for a copy of the netiquette guide.  This
guide will also help you when you want to post a 'me-too' or 
'test-please-ignore' message to r.a.f.  Similarly, it will tell you to include
a BRIEF recap of the preceeding discussion, if NECESSARY, in your post (see
above) rather than reposting entire articles with your additional comments
wedged in.

Oh no.  You got the alternate group names all wrong.  I thought about
this for all of 10 seconds, and I think this would be a better grouping:

    * sci.math.frp - to discuss the underlying mathematics of fantasy
        role-playing games (e.g. Fantasy Hero)
    * sci.math.rpg - to discuss the underlying mathematics of role-
        playing games (e.g. Champions)
    * sci.math.stat.frp - to discuss the statistical aspect of fantasy
        role-playing games
    * sci.math.stat.rpg - to discuss the statistical aspect of role-
        playing games
    * sci.psychology.frp - to discuss the psychological implications
        and effects of fantasy role-playing games
    * sci.psychology.rpg - to discuss the psychological implications
        and effects of role-playing games
    * sci.physics.frp - hardcore discussion of physics in a fantasy
        role-playing game
    * sci.physics.rpg - hardcore discussion of physics in a role-
        playing game
    * soc.culture.frp - to discuss the fantasy role-playing game
        subculture and its relation with the mundanes 
    * soc.culture.rpg - to discuss the role-playing game subculture
        and its relation with the mundanes
    * comp.sources.frp - for source material used in fantasy role-
        playing games
    * comp.sources.rpg - for source material used in role-playing 
        games
    * rec.arts.frp - for fantasy role-playing game related stories
    * rec.arts.rpg - for role-playing game related stories
    * news.groups.frp - to discuss new fantasy role-playing game 
        newsgroups
    * news.groups.rpg - to discuss new role-playing game newsgroups

I am sure there are many other newsgroup ideas I have missed.
Please followup on this the discussion to news.groups.frp or
news.groups.rpg.  Since most of us only read one of those 
groups, please also cross-post what you post to one group to
the other.

I thank you, and the net thanks you.

By the way, I have come up with this truly great idea for a 
notesfile.  This bbs has grown so large that most of us cannot
follow all the discussions going on.  Often times some 
interesting thread would appear and disappear without most of
us noticing.  What we need is a newsgroup to announce the 
presence of interesting discussions so the rest of us can know
where to "tune in". 

Hey, the guy in the next cubicle is snickering.  He says we
should call this notesfile mod.ber.  Isn't he funny?  I thought
all the mod groups disappeared a couple of years ago.  And why
is he laughing?  I am SOOOOOOO confused.

Dan Bernstein, where are you?

You have the right to narrow your area of interest.  But as a
multi-genre (and multi-system) player/GM, I find many (though
certainly not all) of the topics here to be at least interesting.

Freedom of expression.  If some people can't express themselves as
eloquently as you would like, that's your problem.  As for .sigs, I
try to remove as much extranious informtion as I can (unless I'm in a

Quite true.  It's easier for people to see the reaction of the readers
of this group in the net rather than having to ask the originator what
the results of the discussion was (If we even remember the person in
question).

Correction follows:  The appropriate group is news.groups.

So you wish to devote .frp to D&D alone?  What about GURPS Fantasy
campaigns?  What about Fantasy HERO?  What about all of those other
fantasy systems that you would lay by the wayside in you zeal to
'purify' the newsgroup?  And what about mixed-genre games like
Shadowrun?

Also, the 'language' of rpg's has become somewhat standardized (PC,
NPC, GM, d<whatever>).

I agree.  Show me a game where everything is finished, and I'll show

Good luck!  Poeple have been trying to split up rec.arts.startrek for
years.  It hasn't happened and shows no sign of happening.  And
.startrek gets two to three times the number of articles .frp gets.

Damn straight.  I recall sometime in the past when someone wanted to

Seriously, this has become one of the most used groups that I subscribe
to.  I agree with the suggestion that it be split up though into what
parts I haven't figured out yet (and probably won't bother to try).  I
*do* think that this is the place to *raise* the question as to whether
we need other groups, since the people who contribute here are firstly
going to be the ones most likely to vote on the proposal, and secondly
are going to be the ones to actually use any new groups.
Comments?

In-Reply-To: message from wcol...@eniac.seas.upenn.edu <>
   I quite agree, Mr. Walter Collins, bravo for you!  It particularly annoys
me when someone quotes a quote quoting a quote... because a) it wastes space
when I am sure people still remember what the discussion is about, and b) I
have no mail editor so I can't do it myself!
   Discussions which are off the point of the message area are also annoying,
although it's inevitable that "conversations" drift in and out of the
necessary topic area.
   The best that we can do, all of us, is to be brief and to the point.  I
admit there are some subjects which can "get me going", but if you happen to
be bored with what I say, hit the "cancel" key and I say fine!  Maybe whoever
runs this area can also warn those who are particularly long-winded or abuse
quotations.

rec.games.rpg is abandoned because the group was created under .. umm..
suspicious circumstances.  The principals involved in its creation are
still on the net, so I will leave it up to them to disclose the details.
You still see the group probably because your news admin is lazy about 
rmgrouping stuff.  (But then I shouldn't say anything, since I haven't
bothered to rmgroup rec.games.rpg here either.)

We can measure speeds by computing the time taken by a particle to traverse
a given distance.  The speed of light can also be measured experimentally.
There is no need for such gross assumptions.  All we have to go on when
verifying a theory is observation, ultimately.

Special relativity has only two postulates:

1. The laws of physics are the same for observers in all inertial reference
   frames.  No frame is singled out or preferred.
2. The speed of light in free space has the same value c in all directions and
   in all inertial reference frames.

There is no assumption that a massed object cannot reach the speed of light.
That is a consequence of these postulates.  There is solid experimental
evidence for #2.  Maxwell's equations dealing with electromagnetism were
experimentally derived and are part of #1.

Correct.  However, the speed of light limitation is a consequence of
special relativity theory, not an assumption.

First, velocities do not add in that manner according to special relativity.
A simple presentation of special relativity can be found in "The Feynman
Lectures of Physics".  According to the predictions of special
relativity, .5c + .5c -> .8c, and .8c + .5c -> ~ .9285714286c.

Second, all our experience with the physical world is through observation.  A
good physical theory should be able to predict observations.  If the apparent
velocity is all we can see and measure, why should we define some "real"
velocity to be different?

I heartily disagree! Not all of us are fortunate enough to have access to the
other role-playing news groups and yes, "fantasy" can include science fiction
and other genre in it's definition (outside of reality). I like this newsgroup

It can be a little extra effort (expand scale to 3 inches by 1 1/2 inches
for standard car) but it's neat to try a few times. Basically, mount cars

Neither of us have bragged about it, particularly.  We've discussed it
and used it as an example (one that we're fairly familiar with,
obviously).  And if you don't like the messages, you don't have to
read them.  There are some people on the net who are interested in

Takes all kinds.  Now why don't you show a little tolerance

[104 lines of additional text deleted here]  (This is brief?)

I would strongly suggest that you reread the posting regarding what
this newsgroup is about.

If you want a conference that only discusses D&D (or AD&D), and you're
limited to 1200 baud, I'd suggest that you tie into a local FidoNet
node that carries AD&D or D&D conferences (you're only tied into a
10,000 node network that way, I'll admit, but you'll ONLY get what
you're looking for). Or try and get a newsgroup started that is devoted
only to topics you're interested in.
