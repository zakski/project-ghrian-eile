TITLE: To Chester H Zeshonski - address? 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tuesday, 11 December 1990 17:36:58 UTC - Kay Shapero:
What's your net address?  All of your messages are coming in with a message
 
id number, and the indication that you're @eerie.acsu.Buffalo.EDU <http://eerie.acsu.Buffalo.EDU> but not
quite enough information to send you e-mail.
Now I DID reply to your message headed "Kay Shapero read this" some time
ago, yet from some of your comments it's obviously not gotten there.  
Accordingly, here's the gist of it again.  If you've already gotten the
message by the time this one gets there you can disregard it - I'm not
calling you on it twice.  (In fact I'd send it e-mail if I could - see
above.)

Y'see, what you did was the functional equivalent of saying "the male 
Chester Zeshonski, whose Net Spellbook is on my killfile."  First off,
just as you didn't post the Net Spellbook, I didn't post the Other Suns
material (it was John Redden, as a matter of fact.)  Second, the ONLY thing
 
you had to say to and about me was what my sex was, and that I was
responsible for something that you didn't like.  Consider - all you had
to do in your introduction of the subject matter if you had to do so at
all was the simple "gentlemen and ladies"; you didn't have to qualify it
at all.  That you did, and for the apparent sole purpose of delivering an
insult followed by a quick "save" was annoying.  Unexpected gratuitious
insults ARE.  I decided to let you know how annoying in the hopes that
you would not do such things in future.  I also rather wanted to know
why you did it in the first place.  Why did you?

(In case the software is doing similar odd things to my remarks, my own
net address from usenet is Kay.S...@f524.n102.z1.fidonet.org <>)
