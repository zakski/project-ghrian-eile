TITLE: Blood Bowl Review 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wednesday, 28 November 1990 22:12:04 UTC - Chester H Zeshonski:
        OK, the news from today, ladies (we *do* have some out there besides
Kay Shapero whose Other Suns is on my Killfile [sorry, Kay!], don't we? [she's
the only one I can recall seeing]) and gentlemen; or "*for* today", if you 
must, (aren't you glad I don't write "LoM" like this?) is that I will be inclu-
ding a brief (read: pretty short, in comparison) review of the Elves, Dwarves, 
& Dungeonbowl Game.  The reviews will be finished up starting tomorrow with a
review of the _Star Players Handbook_.  Until then, cheers!
        (No offense to Kay Shapero, I'm just very tired and can't honestly re-
member seeing another female out there besides her...)
        Reminder:  Post any questions you may have to the net, or e-mail me
with some suggestions/requests you might have.  That's what this board and my
account are for, you know...

Well, Chet, I have a question to pose.  As a person that has been getting
more and more involved in the board/wargamming and less and less involved with
RPGs (more from available players than want), I would like to see some
discussion of new games coming out in this area.  Not, Edition 2 of something
or Revised or Advanced such and such, but news games.  I've played many
of the old AH games but am looking for new things (besides, Christmas is
coming up).
 
Anyone?

OK, a few points...
        Just for the record, I don't "wargame".  Granted, I've formerly been an
avid player of Axis & Allies, Fortress America, and Shogun, but have not picked
them up any time lately.  To tell the truth, you can finally find exactly what
you want on rec.games.board, which has plenty of wargaming posts (and many re-
views, but I hope you like Civilization, or you're going to be spending a lot 
of time killing Civ. articles<---Walter, take note!) and many reviews on all
sorts of board games (I mean largely wargames).
        Also, all of my latest posts on Blood Bowl have been cross-posted to 
rec.games.board, just so no one will miss them...
        And, also to Walter...you would probably have me take my silly game to
rec.games.blood_bowl.misc.unfiltered_trash, even though it was on this very
board that I first saw any posts on the greatest of games...
        If you don't like it, use a Killfile.
        
If you don't mind me asking, what does "AH" stand for?  (I'll probably kick my-
self when I hear the answer)

Hey, I didn't see anyone, so I'm trying...

Well, first off AH = Avalon Hill.
 
Ok, well, I had replied to the message on Blood Bowl from the 
rec.games.board newsgroup but it crossposted back to here, thats why I asked
about new stuff.  Guess I'll have to go back and post there.
 
(Oh, yeah, your right, I've been killing Civilization stuff left and right.)
 
Ok, the how about what is new coming out in RPGs this Christmas?

Too late - I'm afraid the earlier part of your message WAS quite
offensive.  Was it the fact that I am female that caused you to set
your kill file to delete anything I wrote?  Would it help you to know that
I did not in fact write the game you apparently despise and that the
author was male?

        Do you have BIG boots? Try Avalon Hill. :-).
        This may be a minor thing, or maybe not. Lots of postings in this
newsgroup (and others) use acronyms, or intials, or some other shorthand that
isn't immediately obvious to everyone. Sure, I'm a lazy typist too, but is it
too much to ask if posters write the something out in full the first time?
