>Are you tired of going away for the weekend and coming home to 80 more
>redundant personal letters between FRP'ers?  
I don't ever recall seeing that many personal letters in even a week or more!

>Are you a "traditional" gamer who couldn't care less about lasers or 3-D 
>Combat or Cyberpunk?  

I am a traditional gamer, but I enjoy those postings, and those that I don't
care for, I just put in my kill file.

>Are you as tired as I am of the majority of posters including other people's
>signatures or quoting someone who quoted someone else who quoted someone
>else before that?  

It is necessary to follow the thread of discussions.  However, I can see where
you are coming from when people do include entire signatures of the people
that they are quoting.

>Or of hearing the Shapero's brag about their OTHER SUNS game?  

Nope.  Because many people brag about this or that that they have written,
and just because the Shapero's got theirs published doesn't mean that they
should stop.  I have seen many postings asking them to tell them more about
the game, so there is no problem.  If you don't like it, just put their
names in your kill file.

>Problem 1:  If the subject matter is interesting to me, I will have already
>        read the article(s) being quoted and re-quoted.  A brief synopsis
>        of the intricacies is more than appropriate.

Nope.  Because in many cases, the followups reach a site before the original
article, and if people did not quote that original, others would become easily
confused.

>Problem 2:  Why is EITHER of these articles coming over the net anyway?
>        E-mail is certainly called for.

Because people wish to talk about them and they feel that they apply to the
topic of the newsgroup.

>Problem 3:  I'm tired of having to page over "RE: 3-D Combat" articles.
>        Most of my net-time (like now, for instance) is spent on a 1200
>        baud modem dial-in.  It takes TIME just to scroll over the HEADERS!

Most of my net time is also spent over 1200 baud lines, but I am not going
to demand others only speak of the topics that I like just for that fact.
Why don't you use kill files?

>1.  If I am way off base, mail me.

You are way, way off base.

>2.  Don't write ANY MORE followups to "3-D Combat" (there are already
>several hundred), "Things you never want to see in RPG's", "Fiend Folio",
>"The best SCI-FI game system", or "Faster than light".

If I find that I have a reason to, then I will.  Your nor anyone else has
the right to tell me what I can or can not post to rec.games.frp with the
exception of reminding me when my topic has nothing to do with the group.

>3.  Again, use EMAIL whenever possible.  It's almost always appropriate.

Not necessarily.  If I want to get into a discussion of the best SCI-FI game
system, then the newsgroup becomes the ideal place to discuss it and get input
back and forth from the many members.

>4.  I have given this suggestion some amount of thought.  Perhaps there
>should be alternate groups for some of this stuff to be put into.  

Don't you read the monthly postings?  Splitting this group up has been tried
many times before without success.  You are more than welcome to try again as
I think it is not too bad an idea though I think that the group names you came
up with were a bit ridiculous.

>I don't think it is unfair to leave rec.games.frp for the "Swords &
>Sorcery" crowd.  That's where FRP began, anyway.

But, that is not where it is now.
