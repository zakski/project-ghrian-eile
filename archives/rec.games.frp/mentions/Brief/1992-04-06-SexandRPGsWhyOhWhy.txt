TITLE: Sex and RPG's - Why Oh Why ?

Monday, 6 April 1992 08:42:47 UTC+1 - c903...@cc.newcastle.edu.au:
I'd like to call on the experience of you all to answer me a question.
It seems to me that the number of female roleplayers (not characters!)
is surprisingly small - in my experience of role playing (about 8
years, mainly AD&D) I have seen fewer than ten females who were at
all serious about gaming.
I was wondering if this is the case with the rest of you. Is the fairer
sex poorly suited to gaming, perhaps? Do they just have better things
to do than sit around a table roling dice, speaking in jargon (whether
fantasy, futuristic or whatever) and wandering in imaginary places? Or
is it just me?

For the record, I am a bloke (that's MALE to all you non-Australians),
and an avid gamer.

Please flame by mail. It makes life easier for the rest of us.

Remember when we played tanks & guns & rocketships?
Our sisters were playing house with dolls.
Sometimes we would join the "house" game,
sometimes they played our games with us.
No absolutes implied here...
but would YOU play "Barbie: The Role Playing Game"?
Or "The House that Wouldn't Stay Clean"?
for most of us guys, "Doctor" is as close as we're willing
to get to playing a game we played with girls.
Our RPGs continue much of what we have always liked,
and they contain little (relatively, mind you) of what the
girls liked. So on that note alone it is little suprise to me
that more guys than gals get into RPGs. My wife wouldn't
have, if I weren't in it and that tells more of one story.
That is partly because she had two children (now: 5.5, hits
6 in August) and little screamers make hell out of a tense
combat moment. Shadowrun and Pottyrun don't mix.
This is why my wife & I play mostly just the two of us.

Another factor is the marketing of the games. Here I draw
mostly from my AD&D experience... which says enough right
there; but I'll say more, anyhow.
If you are ROLE-players, and are GUYS, and play a female
character, and if one of the players is a gal... have you ever
(if not, try!) talked to the gal(s) about how realistic your
protrayal of womanhood (in the context of the game senario) is?
I've seen lots that play gals like gals thought with their tits just
the way the player thinks with his dick.

Scene (doesn't matter what game system or setting):
"You walk into what used to be a town. Earthquake plus
firestorm plus tax collectors have been here". What do we do?
look for a bar that rents rooms for the night. Jeesh. How often
are your female characters moved to compassion for the
widows and orphans? Have you ever answered:
"Screw the duke, he can get a new daughter and have fun trying.
Jake, Paula, pass the word around. We're setting up a hospital
and shelter there. Grunt, Slammer, take that building apart
the rest of the way and lay out the beams and boards. Keep
the pieces as big and as good as possible. I'll go pound stakes
for cornerstones. Mumbledigits, if we dig a trench can you put
a wall of something into it to give shelter? DM... we'll be here
three weeks."
Yeah, guys can be thus moved to action, let me stick out
my neck and say, in general gals are more so inclined. The
usual game does not make room for this mentality.

Have a nice day.

In my experience (which is admittedly limited, but then that's what this
thread is about, right?), female role-players - so far all of them with
female characters, are more bloodthirsty and itchy for combat than the
guys.

Perhaps it's because they have to go further to escape their personal
realities. Or perhaps it's just that the few women I have played with (no
smart remarks please) tended to be of the munchkin ilk, and not just in
roleplaying.

Come to that, last time we played, it was cyberpunk... guess what guys,
they do tend to think with their soft and squishy parts (according to that
session) just like us :)

The one female I have ever role-played with turned aside from it because
it was too "technical."  Now, before the napalm throwers come out,
realise that there isn't a lot of emotion attached to all the numbers
involved in role-playing, and women tend to be more emotional than
men.
Hmmm---now that I have thoughourly chewed up to about the knees, I think
I will just say that yes, women tend not to role-play as much as men
in my experiance with D&D and Champs.

Another person's tuppence...
I've roleplayed with females only rarely.  They tend to be more
into the character development and interpersonal relationships
(and suprisingly, it's non-sexual most of the time =O  [smiley
for the sardonic-impaired]) than the combat.  Not to say that
males were solely interested in combat, but the five or ten
females I've encountered were uniformly uninterested in combat.

One female roleplayer that I had the good fortune to game with in a
RuneQuest campaign almost invariably played characters who were named
"Tiger Lily" or "Lotus Blossom" - and could usually castrate a fly at
300 yards with a longbow or some such... In one rather long and very
interesting RQ campaign her character became involved with one of the 
local "indignitaries" and eventually married him. That didn't stop her
from adventuring though... She had special armour made and kept right 
on going. I think that by the time the campaign finished she had had
five children... (Most of the rest of us, all male, sat around the table
in varying states of distraction... ;->

Being at college helps in this regard. In our Star Trek campaign, we have, out
of nine players, three were female (however, upon thinking about it now, were p
retty stereotyped into their jobs...CMO, Chief Engineer, and Communications).
It wasn't that hard to get our friends into role playing, since WE did it enoug
h. We just started a ADnD2 game this past weekend with four players and a DM.
two players are female.

It's all just your surroundings. We have a large proportion of female gaming fr
iends mostly because that attracted us to them. We became friends because we ha
d that common bond. Either that, or we dragged an rpg virgin to a game and she
liked it enough to stay...

Yet another, "from my experiences" followup.

IMHO, from observation of past groups I have played in, the 
longest lasting of which were:
         3 male: 2 female
         5 male: 3 female
         5 male: 2 female

I believe that it is the image.  The image of the game is
all outsiders often see.  I would bet many a person of either sex
is put off by overhearing a lunch talk with more game-talk than
English.  Some people would probably be interested if they were
asked or had the nerve to ask to just come see what goes on at a
game.  

One of the women I work with asked to do just that.  She's only
heard of the game and is interested because her granddaughter
plays.  The only reason she knew to ask me is because she
recalled a stray comment or two I have made in the past.  She
was brave enough to ask.  I'll bet there's others who aren't but
are still interested.  An effort should be made to invite more
women to play while avoiding the dreaded "boy's night out" image.

Also gaming often uses up a lot of time, and that time might be
taken from time spent with friends and family. In every group
I've played in with more than one female, they were really good
friends or roommates.  They were gaming together just as they
would go to the movies together, et cetera.  A friend's wife
wouldn't play AD&D with us until one of the other guy's
girlfriend agreed to come.  She loved it and continues to play,
but that initial feeling of foreigness around all the "guys"
held her back for quite a while. Obviously gaming is not
everyone's cup of java, but I'll bet it would be easier to get
more women to play if you didn't target an individual.  Instead
ask two who are friends.

I found the 10:1 ratio to be valid in the US about ten years ago, but that
ratio is changing.  Part of the problem is female subculture.  At least in
the USA, female subculture (as opposed to male subculture) is far less
tolerant of "being wierd" than male's.  I have to cite merely anecdotal
evidence for this, but my fiancee is a gamer, and she studied martial
arts (jui-jutsu/aiki-jutsu/aikido/kempo-jutsu--all at once--the Soke believed
in eclecticism over specialization).  In her dorm during her sophomore year
she was known as a "kung-fu wierdo".

Furthermore, the nerd subsubculture of male subculture is not all that
friendly to females.  In general, it consists of young and not so young
men who have difficulty relating in social contexts, and they associate
women with these contexts.

However, these hurdles are being overcome, and in the US, female gamers are
on the rise.

Did you try *asking* some ladies to join your campaign?  Works wonders. 

From what I've seen, however, you're right--there seem to be fewer female 
gamers than male.  I daresay it's more a lack of opportunity than ability,
though.  So invite a few girls to join.  Chances are, they'll fit in nicely.

I thought that also at one time. To my surprize, there are a lot of women
gamers.

In the game I am playing now, we have two women players and their pressence
adds a lot to the game.

Also, at the I-CON convention there were a LOT of way kool babes who gamed.

I enjoy creating personalities, telling a story in which I am a
participant, performing heroic and clever deeds, and forming a world
with a bunch of friends.  Perhaps this is related to my vocation, as I
am studying to be a writer.

I don't profess to speak for all the women in my generation.  However, I
can tell you about my childhood.  I never liked playing house with
dolls.  And I don't get a kick out of doing laundry, either.  I played
soccer, commando, and strategic games like chess because they interested
me.  I did (and still do) enjoy stories about knights, dragons, mad
scientists, aliens, etc.

Personally, I have no difficulty translating numbers into more tangible
descriptions of objects or scenes of appropriate carnage.  I don't
believe that women are more emotional than men.  I will agree that women
are more likely to show their feelings.  As for women being more
compassionate than men, I occasionally like to incinerate and torture
bad guys, too.  I don't see how I'm profoundly different from any other
gamer.
I'm not trying to flame or antagonize any of my fellow gamers.  I'd like
to hear your comments.  Please excuse the long-windedness of this reply.

Oh, I HATED playing with dolls and playing house!  I once weirded out a

or something to that effect...Me, I liked Legos, Scrabble, softball,

Hmm...I've only had one female character.  I don't like playing women. 
And, as a rule, I don't like to play combat-monsters.  I'm more
interested in character development.  As for, Can She Play A Man?, I
only recall one complaint.  Our characters were having an argument. 
Mine was very stubborn, and stomped off.  He later returned and muttered
something to the effect of, "You're right--I was being stubborn and
stupid.  I see what you mean--but I STILL don't want to do that!"  I
learned afterward that another player said jokingly to the GM, "A real
man wouldn't back down like that!"

This same player, BTW, had played two female characters in a previous
campaign.  There was no sappiness, etc., but that's because they were
BITCHES, and he did it *really* well!

At risk of being flamed, perhaps my GM or any of the people I play with
could elaborate on the way I play?

Well it could be that we like to spend our days and nights in small dug
out chambers when it is nice and sunny outside.  Also not many of my
many male companions have high marks on social graces.  We are just a
bunch of creative geeks and nerds that have found that there is more to
life then hunting women.  (Well I did meet my aformention SO through
gaming).  IMHO I belive that the people that play rpgs are similar to
the people in Egineering and hard scienecs; Great minds, but can't
communicate.

Someone asks: Is the fairer

I propose that this is the wrong question. Is gaming poorly suited to
women? There is some reason to think so, as many gender studies have
found, as a rule, that it is relationships between people/entities that

are of interest to women. Generally. When was the last time you saw
a section in an FRPG discussing how to get along with team members, or
sociological conflict beteen peoples
?

Yea, there is some, and yea, there are female gamers, but I think
this does provide a hint as to why it's so unevenly male. I'm sure
there are others.

As the GM, it seems Faye misheard.

        I was the one who made the comment, and it was more of a joking comment
that 'A guy wouldn't admit that he was being irrational. He may be being
irrational, but he wouldn't admit it!'

        This is more along the lines of playing someone from another culture.
Women may be unaware of the common 'man culture' that men tend to get
snagged in, as men are of 'woman culture'. That's the only problem with
playing crosssex.

        Oh, and about the comment on rules, personally I tend to use as few
rules as possible. And when I do use a rules system, I invariably end up
ignoring it. I find rules only useful for some hints on how a character
is, and for creating characters.

Fair comment, but it relates more to the preferences of a small group
of people than anything else.  The kind of stories that the EGG crew
decided to model were a very male-oriented kind of story, and that's
the kind of story people still tell.  If they'd been fans of Gothic
Romance, then perhaps a group of mostly women would be here posting
about the greater appeal of role-playing to women than men.  Especially
since it'd then be labeled as "girl-stuff", and then even the male
nonconformists probably wouldn't play any such thing.

I remember two of my female cousins who collected plastic horse models.
They not only collected them, but had intricate stories about each one
and it's history in the herd (there were perhaps 50 horses altogether).
Even at the male-chauvinistic stage of Junior High, I remember thinking
that their stories were much better than a lot of stuff that gets
published.

What they did was shared story-telling, _very_ closely akin to role-
playing.  They only needed the spark of an idea to become full-fledged
gaming.  (Not a word about the all-horse campaign from those of you
snickering in the back...)  It's too bad I'd never done any gaming at
that point either.

OTOH, I played a lot of war games with my fellow kids of both sexes way

 BB>that more guys than gals get into RPGs.

Especially if munchkinism is as prevalent as I gather it is from some
of the postings in here.  Curiously enough, back in the early days of
this hobby I recall playing D&D with a number of folks of both sexes and
didn't run into any problem with it.  I was the only GM in the Klingon
Star Empire, and the fact that I was female certainly didn't seem to
bother the (largely male) Klingons.  

OK - I'd say from what I've read and heard in here that the big problem
is that the hobby is no longer new, and has long since moved into the
niche held by wargaming in high school.  Where sex roles are heavily
segregated (no matter what they tell you) and enforced by the general
tendency of teenagers to be simultaneously going through a number of
physical and emotional changes and terrified that other teenagers will
notice, so that they try desperately to appear like all the others.
This is not likely to change in the near future, so your best bet is
probably to try and lure near relatives and college age folks and older.
I got into this hobby via science fiction fandom back when it was
VERY new, and while we all spent most of our gaming time bashing through
gilded holes, most of the game still had to be made up on the fly by the
GM & players.  It was fun.  Just about everyone I knew who played also ran
his or her own world, and it was several years before I encountered, in
someone else's Alarums & Excursions's zine the curious notion that one
should only play one's own sex.  Heck; I never much cared for playing my
own SPECIES... I do that all the time.

So, want to interest the females in your vicinity in gaming?  First off,
invite them to join in the game.  Make them feel wanted as players. 
You know, beings with brains and ideas who make decisions.  Try to issue
the invitation in such a fashion that they do not feel you are trying to
hit on them.  (If you are, pick a different tactic; there are much better
ones...)

Second, do not treat them and their characters as intruders who must be
chased away.  Stories of the "and then she got upset when we raped her
character and quit playing" variety suggest either INCREDIBLE stupidity
on the part of the players or active attempts at chasing away the outsider.  
Hint - if her mage just fireballed your fighter, you probably said or
did something you shouldn't have.  Try not to repeat it. :->

Third, there probably is something in this assumption that women in general
are more apt to enjoy roleplay in general than trashing something.  So if
there is more character interaction, in the long run you will likely retain
more female players.  Just remember every single player is an individual,
and you're dealing with a population which is all to familiar with being
treated as though they belong in a common mold, and then looked down at.

One thing I do know; anything that looks remotely like patronising will be
treated with a healthy "Take The Nasty Stuff Away".  I'm reminded of the
time I saw a screwdriver with a flower-print handle for sale in the store
under the name "My Very Own Screwdriver" with a picture of a smirking
female face.  It stayed on the shelf for a very, very long time...  
(Small wonder - I'd have rather used a DIME.)

Touche!  I think it takes an addle-pated twit to even suggest that women
are poorly suited to gaming!  This comment must have originated from
male-chauvenist who belittles females...no wonder YOU haven't seen many
females serious about gaming.  Do you ever give them a fighting chance?
What range of characters can you role-paly effectively?  I have a hot-
tempered mu, a level-headed kensai, a kleptomaniac thief, and a sweet-
scamming bard who sidelines as an assassin.  All have different unique
personalities, morals, and actions.

It's just you.  I'm a female gamer who experiences withdrawal symptoms if
I'm unable to game for a week or two.  I revel in my imagination and my
ability to project a character effectively.  If it's your experience that
females have better things to do with their time, perhaps you don't make
them feel a part of your group.

>though.  So invite a few girls to join.  Chances are, they'll fit in nicely.
I have to agree that, in general, there *do* tend to be more male gamers
than female, but luckily I've not been involved in that boring scenario.
In all of the gaming groups I've been involved with, females comprised
half, if not more, of the gamers.  Never have we had any female characters
who slept around, were simpy, overly compassionate, and hated combat.
In fact, I know a certain female dwarven fighter who would slice a person
in half for even suggesting she dislikes combat--she THRIVES on it!  She
even sports a jacket with the warning..."Mess with the best..Die like the
rest".  And while she would swing with her hammer, her spitfire mage
companion would zap with magic missiles followed by a fireball (depending
on how offensive the derogatory comments had been).

I can't say that the men in our current gaming group don't enjoy role
playing their characters as much as the members "of the fairer sex" do
because they get into it just as much as we do.  I feel sorry for the
single-sex gaming groups made up of solely men who only hack and slay
and talk about women (these types do exist--I've sat in on a few games
like this).  These types of groups miss the point of frp.  Gamers should
give characters more CHARACTER than the above mentioned mentality, It
makes for a much more interesting game.  If you currently belong to a
gaming group lacking in female gamers, by all means ask some (you'd be
surprised how many would love to join you) and see how it adds spunk to
your game.

For the record I too am a woman and an avid gamer and wouldn't have
it any other way.

        Actually, IMHO, that is as sexist as anything else. I've
played (of all things) a necromancer (male) who would have stopped to
help the victims. He would have had the newly dead clearing the rubble
and making the wounded comfortable in no time. And then set about
healing the wounded and fixing the crippled.

        And don't forget, there _are_ some women who fit the "thinking
with their chest" role. I've seen more fights at girls' basketball
games than at guys'. 

        The key to role-playing is to try to take on the role, not
just play every character the same.

requires choosing the right game to start them on.  I have had good success
with the game "Lace and Steel" which can easily be played like a bad historical

*Sigh*  Well as long as this seems to be the contreversy (sp?) of choice,
I figure that I might as well put in my .02 nuyen.
It's my HO that the whole question of sexism in FRPGers is rapidly becoming
moot.  Historically, RPGers were male: this is probably more because men 
designed the first RPG's in the first place, and playing them was considered
a "boys night out" kind of thing (among nerds like myself, admittedly).  I 
strongly doubt that the high ratio of male to female gamers has anything to do 
with the quality of female role-players in general.  Saying that smacks of pure
ignorance; are actors more talented than actresses?  Are male authors superior
to female ones?  These days (fortunately), most people would never take an 
argument like that seriously.

Furthermore, I should add that there are only three people I know whom I have 
played with enough to feel safe in calling them outstanding role-players.  Of
these three, two were female.  (one, however, is my SO, so my opinion may be
biased).

The characters these people play almost seem as real people to me.  One, Kiri
Treeborn (aka Nightshade) is an elven Owl shaman (Shadowrun) with very strong
ethical principles.  At one point, I ran her party through the Hates section of
"Harlequin".  After the job, which involved a good deal of wetwork, was 
explained to them by their potential employer, the "Johnson" asked "Okay?"
Before anyone else had a chance to reply, Kiri said "No," stood up, and walked
out.  It doesn't sound like much, but it was very characteristic of the quiet 
elf to refuse on ethical grounds alone, thereby eliminating her share of the
profit.  

As far as art goes, even _that_ seems to be changing to a great degree.  A
quick perusal of Shadowrun (excepting the front cover) and its sourcebooks,
Vampire: The Masquerade, Torg, Gurps will show that most of the "offensive" art
of bygone times seems missing in later games.  Certainly, some of the females 
in SRun are beautiful, but others are downright terrifying (for example, Rat 
Mash Dancer, the Ork shaman from Ivy & Chrome).  And the men look like
everything from buffed muscle men to the shmoe next door (ie, FBI agent Clive
Drummond from NAN I... at this point, I'll put in a plug for my favorite
illustrator, Tim Bradstreet).  Sure, stereotypes abound, but not nearly to the 
same extent that they did ten years ago... or even five years ago.

But, I've been rambling.  The point is, men and women are not the same, but
they're not as different as all _that_.  Play with a few and you'll see what
I mean.

I've known, in eight years of gaming (AD&D), two other women who played
regularly, and one who played sporadically. I've met others at conventions
and such, but in terms of friends, I've only known three other females
who were 'into' gaming.

Most people get into gaming during junior high or high school. In
junior high, most girls are busy squealing like all their brain cells
were suddenly and violently nuked. The last thing they want to do is
to hang around 'those geeks who play those weird games'.

Role-playing is not a 'cool' thing to do, in your average high school.
The types of people who play RPGs are usually also science/technology
types, and often 'nerds'. The number of women who share these interests
is much lower, so your average female usually doesn't have much in common 
with the guys who game.

Oddly enough, there are a lot of women who read sf/fantasy novels.
But they just don't get into computers and gaming and related hobbies
as much. It probably has to do with a society which still quietly
pushes the idea of a meek domestic female who's sensitive, good
verbally, and bad in math.

(My younger sister, who is thirteen, bright, and fairly typical of
 others her age, still insists that, "Computers are for boys.")

The other thing is, guys often don't ask women to game with them.
A lot of the nerds I knew in high school were painfully shy; asking
one of them to go up to a female they didn't know well and simply
talk to her was akin to asking them to try to make friends with
a circling hungry shark.

I have the feeling we'll see an increasing percentage of female
gamers if we can increase the percentage of girls who have strong
interests in mathematics, science, and technology.

 This subject seems to come up a lot.  Hmm...  Anyway, my gaming groups are

recruiting when the group got too big.  The main reason is that around here
the guys start the groups and guys usually know more males than females, its
that simple.  In other groups started by ladies, there are probably more 
ladies than guys for the same reason.  There is probably no more sinister
or mysterious reason that that for the sex breakdown in gaming groups.

In my vast experience, females make up a small percentage of the players.
Maybe they aren't into powertripping, which is what a lot of campaigns
are. Maybe having a full set of X chromosones selects additional common
sense, and they know better then to start a hobby that will eat hours
of free time. Maybe they prefer to hang around with guys that lift
weights and disassemble cars. Who knows? The only females I've met that
talk about this are the ones who play, and they don't seem to know why
other females aren't into it.

I'm make a highly inflammatory statement, since we're wasting time trying
to probe the psyche of players in general and females in particular: in
my experience, female players are rare, but the ones who do get into it
tend to get into it much more seriously - they seem to take their
characters as more "real", and do more much roleplaying than rulegrunging.
Direct your flames to alt.null - this is just my personal experience and
it may not hold for anyone else.

Well, no wonder -- most of the female gamers I know are GURPSians...
(Okay, okay, so *I'm* a GURPSian and tend to meet the same... It's just

Just better things to do than hack&slay.  l-;

So what's Female to an Australian? (Funny, I thouhgt "Bloke" was "male"
in British.... ;-) )
 
Anyway, I'd say that part of the reason there aren't more female gamers
is that good first experiences usually aren't that easy to come by -- at
15, I was co-opted into a lunch-room D&D game with 14-11 year old males.
(Can you say "Monty Haul"?)  Not too many people would be that desperate
to RPG... (But being the *only* mage in a group has compensations.)

And nominally "mainstream" folk are often the norm -- while D&D (or
whatever) is an acceptible "stage" for guys, gals have to be
non-conformists already to even think about it.

        To take it seriously, I think what happens is most amles start playing
AD+D at a young age, at least I did, when females are not quite the only
thing they think of yet, and so DO NOT include females in the game (like
sports). Later they continue to play but have probably through the high
school years stick with the same group of players. When they do start to
pay attention to girls they don't admit there fantasy hobby because they
think it sounds "silly". Many females I know think it is (Like Football
and Beer) so they don't try to involve them. Or just don't think of it.
Also at this point it is low key in general, a group gets together,
plays,  and does not think of adding new players. Later when females may
actually become interested in roleplaying they just don't get the
exposure. I noticed this at many NERO sessions ( New England Roleplaying
Assoc.) It is a live action roleplaying group. You find many females
there, since it is fairly new (at least in NJ) and they are brought into
it independent of any roleplayin experience. I met several females there
who had NEVER played any "book" roleplaying games. In college , When new
campaigns begin, I have also found more females get involved. What it
comes down to is, they often are not given the chance.

You should have been around the time a group of us went out to breakfast

ALL of the female gamers I know play one of the aforementioned games.

        A year ago I ran a GURPS group that included two female players.
INterestingly enough, they not only played on a regular basis but they gave
me some rather original ideas for my own charicters.
        From my experience, female players run two kinds of charicters:
charicters that don't develop because the players don't take the time to
develop them, and charicters that border on psychotic: one player always played
a nymphomaniac and the other came up with the most unusual of charicters-
a schitzo merc who half the time was a quiet, bunnies-and-sunshine kinda guy that
everyone sorta pats on the back and prays will go away and watch his Smurfs
show; and the other half the time was a homocidal Jesus freak that performed
some of the most outrageous stunts I've ever seen as a GM (with the excuse
that "God told him to do that.") 
        (Oh, BTW- If said player is reading this, I *am* using that charicter.)

        The problem was that the other players (all male) got sick of their
PC's and asked the women to leave. Of course I was ready to kill the players;
but the ladies never came back.

        It seems to me, therefore, that the reason we see so few female players
is because when women initially get into the games, they either get bored
or they get razzed.

Um...I've played Warhammer Fantasy, RoleMaster, and GM-made systems
ranging from Sam Robb's GrimRules to no rules.  I personally have no
interest in Cyberpunk, and very little in superhero-type stuff.  My
roommate has played D&D for many years, RoleMaster, GrimRules (she was a
playtester), and another system whose name slips my mind (but it allows
for mutants like intellegent geraniums).  Her former roommate played
RoleMaster.  Another friends likes Paranoia and Palladium.  In fact, I
know of no women who play the games Nicolai mentioned.

Now this may just vary from campus to campus, etc.  It seems there are
quite a few RoleMaster campaigns here, some *D&D, and a variety of
others in smaller quantities including Rifts, Battletech, Paladium,
ShadowRun, Paranoia, super-hero genre, and Cthulu.

My point was that the games we play in are the ones we will run
into women players in.  If one only plays Gurps, then one will
see women Gurps players (or none at all).

What sort of women players one runs into will not be a function
of where one is, but of what games one plays.  The sample is
pre-selected (producing a huge bobble in the statistics).

FYI - you ran a game including two female players.  This is not nearly
a large enough sample to generalize to the entire sex, merely says that
you had two players, one of whom didn't bother to develop her characters,
and another who ran psychoes.  There really ARE other possibilities...

I'm female roleplayer...and in our group there are 3 women and 2 men...
(Greg is my husband, he posted the Lich killing advice message, if anyone is
wondering why he suddenly changed sexes :))
IMHO, i think that there aren't alot of female roleplayers because guys
don't think there capable of grasping the concept...Plus if all the group
does is role dice and get XP's then most females don't want to participate..
I'd much rather play a different personality and use my wits to get out of
a mess than go around hacking and slashing...It stimulates the imagination...
Though I do admit to liking the hack and slash part when the evil being 
you've been stalking for the past couple of campaigns is finally in your 
grasp!!! :)
So thats my 2 cents worth...

I got the impression that this was their first game. how many of us males 
played such characters on our first game? The two ladies never got to 
develope their roleplaying abilities because they were asked to leave. 
My girlriend has played almost as many different systems as I have and she 
is a very good roleplayer, better by far than a lot of guys I've 
incountered. My point is that she was incourged when she first started. If 
anyone doesn't get positive feedback when they try something they are 
probably not going to continue.

Not necessarily.  If you belong to a gaming group, or Interest Club, or
somesuch, you will probably run into gamers who play games that you do not
play.  Most of the women I know who game play games that I do not (primarily
D&D/AD&D), although at least two of them also play HERO (which I do play,
but not usually with them).  In fact, I know about 5 female gamers out of
a sample of, say, 25, and I have only ever actually roleplayed with one of
them, and that no very often.

In general, tho', you are right, that it is difficult to meet roleplayers
of games that you do not play.

Yo, everyone, I just re-read my post. I didn't mean to imply that the psycho
charicters were negative. I really enjoyed having Linda and Heather in my 
games. Like I've already told eeryone who emailed me on my article, I
realy enjoyed having Heather and Linda in my group. Heather was the most 
creative player there - she came up with the homocidal Jesus freak/bunnies
and sunshine shellshocked Merc that Shapero left out of the exerpt. After
getting tons of traditional archetypes I had more fun getting the party in
trouble when that charicter mood swang than any other time I GMed. Furthermore
I should point out that Heather and Linda played these two charicters quite
gracefully. It's very hard playing a psycho elegantly. Ask anyone who's
done it!

And, no, Linda didn't leave her PC to dry up, as Shapero implies. Linda 
developed the nympho quite a bit. The charicter was really quite elegant
given the role she played. 

As for the women I've met who do let their charicters die out, I didn't 
mention an example because none are noteworthy to me as a GM! I just let
them sit there and talk (yes there were more than two female players, 
surprise surprise surprise) while Josh and Marcus and Heather and Linda
did most of the work. 

Well, so much for my bad proofreading.

Nope, but you DID say that all female players either fail to develop their
personalities or run psychoes, and that you knew this on the basis of
having observed two individuals.  If you knew two male players one of whom
always ran very well crafted characters, the other of whom ran psychos
would you assume that all male players ran either well crafted characters
or crazies?

I'm not surprised you got messages; the point was NOT that you said that 
you disliked their characters or thought they played badly, the point was 
that you essentially said that you knew All About Female Players because
you had observed two...

 LB>And, no, Linda didn't leave her PC to dry up, as Shapero implies. 

Where?  Please reread my statement (thoughtfully appended in its entirety
above at the beginning of this post...)  YOU were the one who said you
knew two female players and that one of them didn't develop her characters
and the other played psychoes...

        Good idea!  I'd really like to hear about some of these.  I've never
EVER actually run into a female GM, and I HAVE looked.  Of course, if you look

        Having had only two females in our group, I am limited in experience
although I am actively trying to bring others in.  (Rather, new
people...
the old saying "familiarity breeds contempt" holds true)

        But the two had strikingly different characters, constantly.

        One invariably played "cork on the wave" a character that just bobbed
along with whoever doing whatever.  She never did anything in the sense
of "initiaitve."

        The other, played beautifully, as only an stage performer could.  She
had a wide range of characters with a wide range of concepts.  But they
were all generally strong willed indiviudals and, consequence be damned,
did whatever they felt was necessary.  She would play male characters
while the other would not.

        (how do I know?  Well, the one time she did play a "male" character was
during a Camelot campaign.  I, a PC too, was anything but a night of the
Round Table, a dabbler in the arts and a thief to boot.  So, naturally,
I managed to
have "him" fall victim to a rather nasty sleep spell.  I, still thinking
him to be a male, proceeded to rob the bugger down to his skivvies, when
what should confront my eyes but a set of (y'know) staring at me on
"his" chest.  It's a darn good thing I am a "gentle-robber" or I would
left her butt-naked tied to a tree.)

Friday, 17 April 1992 03:26:05 UTC+1 - Kathleen E Coady:
        Yes, there are female GMs, and I'm one of them.  I run a GURPS fantasy
campaign online (my own world, not Yrth).  I'd do a near-future hard SF/cyber-
punk type game if I had the time.
        I give points for role-playing, not orc-bashing; it seems nonsensical
to me to base awards on living through fights a great many of which shouldn't
have occurred in the first place.  Senseless violence, in my campaign, will
probably get you killed; if the PCs lose a necessary fight, I tend to cheat in
their behalf and not actually kill them...just wind them up in some ghastly
predicament the escaping of which is more plot material.  I'm actually afraid
that I'm more intolerant of the stupidity of getting into fights for no terri-
bly good reason than I am of the violence itself, at least in a game setting.
        I tend to use the PCs' characteristics and backgrounds as plot mater-
ial, rather than having preplanned scenarios that don't have any necessary
connection to the group.  You have to have a group of good roleplayers to get
away with this.  Actually, my style is almost completely improvisational, to
an extent that I've never seen any GM of either sex do.  I know what the 
people and the culture of the lands the PCs are in are like, but a lot of 
things some people plan, I deliberately leave vague so I can work them into
the plot when I need them on 30 seconds' notice.  As you've probably guessed,
I don't draw maps.
        One thing I've never done, and never expect to do, is roll up a random
encounter and use reaction dice to see what happens; if the PCs run into some-
one, the NPC has reasons of his own for being where he is, and an internal
logic of his own to follow, and we play the encounter out.  I guess you could
say my NPCs are people, not random obstacles.  The things I tend to roll are
those that aren't easily played out, don't really have an internal logic, or
that I want decided on a chance basis.

I disagree with your point about there not being a lot of women because guys
feel they can't grasp it.  Don't get me wrong, I'm sure there are plenty who
do.  However, I've moved around quite a bit and played rolepalying games
at most places.  Most of the players were guys but had no qualms nor did
they try to disuade female players.  It seems to be more your second point --
a lot of women do not like the "hack and slash."  On campus, we play in an
open, frequently travelled area.  A large number of people (both men and 
women) will stop by to see who is getting slaughtered that night but only some
of the guys will ask "Need another player?"  We do get into roleplaying though.

Treasure this one, folks, for it is a USENET rarity; a concise answer.

Interesting.  I myself have been part of the fabled "2%" of gamers who 
happen to be female.  My friend who is sitting with me as I post this is 
another.  I started with AD&D in middle school and am still trying to rid 
myself of the traumatic memories (caused mostly by the munchkinism of my 
fellow players.)  In high school, I did a lot of systemless "anarchy" 
playing, including one campaign that has been running since 1988.  Since 
arriving at college, I have gotten into a lot more gaming.  (Especially 
since I fell in love with one of my fellow gamers.  We're engaged now. :))

A quick rundown of campaigns: at a rough count, there are 6 GURPS 
campaigns, TMNTs, V&V, Teenagers from Outer Space, Marvel, a hybrid of 
GURPS and Champions, three anarchy campaigns, and a friend's experimental 
system.  This is not counting the GURPS fantasy campaign that I am 
co-running with my fiancee.  I have gotten involved in all of these since 
arriving on campus in September.  

Some of us do get into this.

Well, as I mentioned in an earlier post on this thread, I am co-GMing a 
fantasy GURPS campaign with my fiance.  We've only had one run, so all I 
can say is that it seems to be going well.  I'm pleased with the world 
we've created and the NPCs, not to mention the quest. :)  I'd be more 
specific, but the players read this.  I originated the idea for this 
campaign, but my fiance and I are truly splitting the workload.  We both 
do the truly creative stuff; he handles most of the game mechanics as well 
because I do not particularly enjoy that aspect.  Our players may have an 
opinion on how my being female affects the campaign.  I don't.
