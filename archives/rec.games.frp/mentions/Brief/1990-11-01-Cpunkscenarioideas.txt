Why not consider occasionally what your characters do when they aren't 
out fighting the system?  What sort of party could you throw with the 
kind of tech available in a cyberpunk mileau?  What's the equivalent 
of going backpacking?  A day at the beach?

In the Other Suns campaign I'm involved in, we occasionally vary 
things by having the characters go on shore leave and get into inter-
esting situations (and no, they don't always involve trouble with the 
SPs.)  Like the time a group went out hunting.  While most carried 
rifles, my own character brought a camera to do her hunting with, 
while another (a H'rel - a race of felinoids with an interesting sense 
of humor) decided to bring along a batch of pies.  Off in the dis-
tance, an NPC hunter made the "large flesh colored squirrel.  A deer 
in a red hunting jacket" mistake and opened fire on the H'rel.  The 
NPC missed.  The H'rel didn't - caught him full in front with a cream 
pie.  My character filmed all of this...

A couple of other characters spent all of their time "hunting" each 
other, and got married a couple of game sessions later!

        This seems to be a problem nearly everyone has with the
Cyberpunk genre: it's hard to break out of the conventional
"employer wants X, hires party, party breaks into corporation,
retrieves X, gives it to employer (optionally gets screwed
by employer), the end" plot.
        A few ideas (not all are mine. Chris Frerking gets a lot
of the credit):

        - The employer's daughter has a) been kidnapped, or
b) run away to join the Moonies. The PCs must recover her. Possible
complication: she doesn't want to return.

        - The PCs are all members of company X. Company Y, whom
the PCs have angered in the past, has just taken over company X.
The PCs must now defect or be killed. A similar situation can
occur with power plays within company X.

        - The PCs are approached by two different employers, both
of whom make mutually contradictory "offers you can't refuse."

        - The employer has something valuable. He has information
that says that a rival will try to recover the item within the
coming week. He then gives the item to the PCs for safekeeping,
until he can take it back. For added spice, make the item dangerous
and make them wonder whether they wouldn't be better off giving/selling
it to someone else.

        One thing that can be exploited is that in a c-punk
setting, virtually everything more complex than a mechanical
pencil (and even some of the fancier mechanical pencils) is going
to be computerized, and possibly hooked up to the Net. An example
of this is in cars:
        Cars no longer have gauges and dials on the dashboard. They
simply have a color display that can be used by the on-board
computer to display whatever's relevant at the moment (not to
mention the fact that if you don't like idiot lights, you can
always change them to dials). This display is also used by the
car phone to show you who you're talking to.
        In addition to all of this, the car can drive itself,
by using internal maps (and/or maps that it reads on the Net).
This requires that the on-board computer be hooked up to the Net
(possibly via the phone), and this implies that a good 'runner
can hijack a car from the privacy of his own home.

On the subject of "what to do" in the cyberpunk genre; I heartily reccomend
FASA's "Sprawl Sites".  The encounter section offers scads of scenario 
ideas.  Even if you don't play Shadowrun, it is extremely useful.  Parts
of it form the backbone of my campaign.   The generic maps are nifty too.
(quick plug mode off)

About the only other thing I can say about ideas for cyberpunk is watch 
movies and TV.  Espically, read, read, read.  Steal any nifty stuff.  File
off the serial numbers and fence it to your players.

One idea I've been toying with is to have the cpnks be inserted into
a Superrealistic Virtual World - something really bizarre.  And make
them have to do some outrageous things to get OUT of it.  
Kind of a Soulkiller program, and if they DIE in the VR, then their
mind imprint (whatever) get's ERASED.  No jacking out of this one for
anyone.
