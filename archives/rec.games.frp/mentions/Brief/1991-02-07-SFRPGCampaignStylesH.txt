TITLE: SFRPG Campaign Styles: How to Determine

 JHR>So what do you other SFRG GMs do to determine the best style of 
 JHR>campaign for your players?

I've been running an SFRPG for about 12 years now (OTHER SUNS,
surprise, surprise) and I've been running mostly military/scientific
missions ("Where no man has gone before" if I am to use
your nomenclature) and espionage missions. The survey missions
have typically had 4-6 players in each session, the espionage
missions have typically had only 1-2 players (and one player for
80% of them).  I tried a series of covert operations missions,
but they were sufficiently bloody that for one reason or another
the players seemed to lose interest (funny about that -- when it
takes half an hour to roll up a character, people don't enjoy
losing one character per game).

The locals have seemed to like the survey missions and the one
"spy" in the group rather likes the non-violent cloak and dagger
stuff (emphasis on the cloak rather than the dagger).  So...I
just pay careful attention to what people seem to enjoy, and
run that sort of game...

-- along these lines.
I ran a STRPG campaign that lasted roughly a year real time, which spread out o
ver several loosely related adventures.  The concept was that the Star Fleet
crew were thrown by a wormhole into an alternate universe with an alternate
time line...so alternate, in fact, that the Federation never came to pass.
Ironically, the relation of the adventure was not as one would expect, the
"we have to get back" routine.  Rather, it took a twist in that the arch-
villains of the Terran Fleet found a way to "tunnel" into the ST universe,
and our heroes had to figure out a way to keep a running dialouge between
Federation Earth and Alternate Earth, while still defending themselves and
*trying* to stay within the precepts of the Prime Directive.  A load of fun
to run and to play (well, that's what the players told me, anyway.)  It was
however, bloody.  Half the PC's were killed in the first two adventures alone.
The players did not seem to mind.  They kept coming back.

I ended the campaign by revealing how to stop the wormhole tunnel process
permenantly.  Unfortunately, it was a risky procedure that claimed the lives
of our intrepid crew.  But they all enjoyed it, and I do occasionally miss
running it.

Just wanted to throw in my $.02
