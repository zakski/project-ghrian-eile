TITLE: Albedo, and other games I play 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wednesday, 2 August 1989 21:49:18 UTC+1 - 5 CR:
 I currently run a 2300AD campaign.  I also own the rules to Megatraveller and agame called Albedo (which is based on the really good comic of the same
name).
        What I would like to know is if anyone out there has heard of the
game Albedo, or has the rules, or reads the comic.  I would like to know
what you think of it.

        Hey, there must be people reading this that like science-fiction
games better than fantasy games.  if you do please post what games you like
and own.  I would like to exchange ideas about these games but I would
really like to know what people out there are playing.

Well, I think I prefer fantasy games (at least at the moment), but I do play
alot of science fiction.

I own Traveller, MegaTraveller, GURPS Space, Mechanoid Invasion (original 3
booklet set), Traveller 2300 (1st ed, is the 2nd ed worth getting?), Space
Quest (D&D in space sort of), Other Suns, Space Opera, and probably a few
others.


I GM mostly heavily modified Traveller. I have done a fair ammount of work
on 'realistic' universe generation. I tend to run exploration type games.

Yes, lets see more SF here.

  I was fortunate enough to know that GDW was coming out with a second
edition of 2300AD last summer, so I waited.  (I have seen the 1st edition)
The second edition is by far much better than the first edition.  You get
over twice as much material.  Each of the books are about 100 pages long.
The way they could do this was to avoid the very expensive covers for the
books that were used in the 1st edition.  I felt slightly disappointed but
then I realized that I would much rather have more material than really
fancy covers.
  Also, the price stayed at $20 for the boxed set.  If you buy it now they
also include a module (Kafer Dawn, from what I have heard it is one of the
crummy modules in the system---but it is a module included at no extra
cost).  Some places are selling it at 24.95 for the boxed set, but you
should still be able to find one place selling it at the lower price.
        Overall, the second edition set is really good and I am very
satisfied with it.

      Once again, I must say that I agree.

        I tend to run games that rely at least a third on politics.  I
bought the Megatraveller game to run a different game system while I was
preparing the other and so I could run more exploration type games.
  
By the way, has anyone out there seen Challenge #39?   The cover is
fantastic but I think the artist could have done better with the shuttle
design.  Also, the Hinterworlds sector is pretty good.  For 2300AD the
French Lts. Connection was also pretty good.

   The background material for the game is pretty good and so are a few of the
ideas like interpersonal conflict and fatigue.  I have adapted for use in 
conjuction with my 2300AD campaign.  Also, my group and I have decided to play
it in one shot sessions whenever I don't want to run 2300AD or the other
GM does not want to run MegaTraveller.

I may be missing something but what are the other two games you are
referring to?  I can see Fringeworthy (never hear of it before, could you 
tell us about it?) and 2300AD.

Own:
Traveller (the good old variety, not this Mega-stuff)
Striker (wargame/miniature combat rules for use with Traveller)
Azhanti High Lightning (similar combat rules to Striker, but based on board
ships.)
Fifth Frontier War (not really rpg, but another spawn of Traveller)
Good character generation (when you buy the add-ons), good combat rules (when
you buy the add-ons - esp. Striker), good background (when you buy the add-ons,
esp. Alien Modules). If you use the add-ons like High Guard and Mercenary, it's
one of the few RPG's to give your character a history. You can end up wounded,
you can end up with medals. You can also end up with neither.


Star Wars
Star Warriors
You don't so much generate characters as choose them, then customise them.
The rules are quick and simple, yet capable of dealing with pretty well any
situation. Watch Clint Eastwood in "Fistful of Dollars", as he shoots three
baddies before they get a shot off. In Star Wars, you can do that too! But
you can do other things beside kill the other guy - you can con him or bargain
with him too, especially if your character is a Gambler.

Okay , I bought the MegaTraveller set.  It seems okay to me.

To those diehard Traveller fans, what is the difference between the
two games?  I thought that MegaTraveller was just a compilation of 
all the current rules.  The reason I never bought Traveller before
the MegaTraveller set came out was that I could not afford the cost 
of all the individual books, especially when later books made only
parts of the earlier books out of date.

With regards to Fringeworthy, it is a Tri-Tac game. Reliable rumors
indicate that this company is at least in a holding pattern if not at
or near death. I'm not close enough to it to know anything for sure.

Fringeworthy, and sister games FTL and Stalking the Night Fantastic,
use a rather detailed system that appears to my eye to be a progressive
development of the Morrow Project system (product of another company
that I don't recall off hand). My primary complaint with it is that an
awful lot of time is spent finding out that the .30-06 round entered
your forearm 5 cm below your elbow, just missing the bone, now the next
bullet in the burst ... . We have an excellent referee of this system,
and even he, by his own admission, gets bogged down when there are a
handfull of beligerants involved.

On the positive side the game is an exploration of a potentially infinite
number of alternative universes. An initial background is well defined,
and comments on a few of the universes are provided to help the refferee
get started. There are few games where in one week one may be fighting
vampires (automatic weapons and flamethrowers none the less) and in the
next session be trying to pacify the James Gang (Rat Patrol meets the
Old West) and still be working on a continuous plot line. In fact, with
a good party and a good referee either exploring or "fixing" problems
in various localities, one need not get into combat very often, and
hence avoid bogging down.

I believe Tri-Tac grew out of the ashes of the company that produced the
Morrow Project ...

On an even more positive note, I should add that Fringeworthy has provided our
local gaming group with many many months of excitement and enjoyable play. The
game system is well-suited to the premise of travelling around alternate
universes because the heightened realism of combat keeps things from eroding 
into a silly exploration of flimsy, cartoon-style universes. Everything must
be coherent, and the alternate universes believable.

The basic premise of the game is that three million years ago, an ancient
race of dimension travelling aliens were destroyed by their shape-shifting
servant race. The benevolent aliens had established a system of portals and
walkways in an inter-dimensional space 'between' the universes that allowed
easy travel for those lucky enough to be in some way like the original aliens.

Thus, only a fraction of humanity can travel through these portals and are
'Fringeworthy'. The Fringe was first discovered in 1990, I think, when an
expedition to Antarctica discovered a cave containing the body of a lost
member of some historical expedition and his journal wherein he described
his adventures through the portal beyond. Deeper in the cave, the expedition
found the portal, and one member of the party accidentally discovered she
was Fringeworthy.

A few years in the future, the players are picked for their first missions
to the Fringe. Armed with some small knowledge of the original aliens and
their fiendish servants, some familiarity with the crystals that control
the portals (reminiscent of Land of the Lost), and below-standard equipment
(the portals won't allow some types of things to pass through), they're off
to see the Wizard ...

Finding a copy of Fringeworthy can be a very difficult thing to do, so if you 
can't my suggestion is to rip them off completely. A few years ago, I, without
any knowledge of Fringeworthy, ran a game where criminals and crazy adventurers
on 21st century Earth were given the chance to take a one-way trip some couple
of million years in the future. There were great restrictions placed on the
type of equipment allowed through the Gate (which was, naturally enough, located
in Saint Louis). I used a book called After Man for descriptions of most of the
fauna, and had a little fun too with inspiration from other games like Empire
of the Petal Throne and Ringworld (ever wonder about how to get your players to
*stay* with any Ringworld race? easy, put them on Earth).

Paul Mech wrote a pretty good description of the Tritac system used
in Stalking the Night Fantastic, Fringeworthy, And FTL.  The reason
the system looks like Morrow project is that Richard Tucholka who
basically is Tritac Games, also was one of the authors of Morrow Project.
While the system allows you to bog down in endless detail for each bullet,
you're better off using some of the fast kill rules if you have many
characters involved in a firefight.  That's the way Richard usually runs
the games when he's reffing.  Only heroes and major villains get detailed
resolution unless there is a plot need for exact results.  Even those
characters may have their injuries resolved by a simpler method if they
take more than a few hits in a round.  Change the depth of fire resolution
on the fly to keep the pacing going and you'll get the effect Richard was
trying to achieve in the games.   Fast action for maximum player fear and
confusion was the general style.  Lots of combat vs overwhelming odds,
time pressure situations, and a tendency for the whole place to come down
around our ears like in the climax of action movies was the flavor of
games I've played in under him.  Played that way, his designs are a lot of
fun.

An official survey was conducted a while ago, maybe someone still
has a copy.  Some of the points which I remember or personally
want to highlight are:

(1) There was pretty unanimous agreement that the MT task
system was a welcome addition.  (Traveller, which I'll call
"OT" for "Original Traveller", had skills but no real rules
for applying them.)

(2) There was unanimous agreement that the editing in MT
is ridiculously shoddy.  (Get the corrections from James
and the TML, they'll make your life a lot easier.)

(3) My personal feeling is that the starship design rules
became overly complicated, and a lot of people seem to think
this.  I also don't like the starship combat system in MT,
but I didn't like the one in OT either.  I understand that
the starship design and combat rules are basically derived
from High Guard (OT), which I also didn't like.

(4) Character generation, while basically the same, has been
altered so that characters generated using the "simple" procedures
are power-compatible with characters generated using the
advanced procedures.  In OT, there was no comparison.

(5) A lot of people don't seem to like the combat system,
which is new to MT.  Personally, I like it.  

(6) The "Shattered Imperium" background was introduced
in MT.  I would probably call this the most significant
improvement, since it has added so much to my own campaigns.
Of course, you could use this setting with the OT rules...

Those are the ones that occur to me at the moment.  If it's
not obvious yet, I have a strong preference for MT.  I don't
think that OT has anything that MT doesn't have, while the
converse is certainly not true.  My biggest complaints with
MT are the editing and the starship design and combat rules.

Since there seems some doubt about Timeline, the company that
produces Morrow Project, I thought I'd mention that they are still
going.  There are 8 adventures out to date.  The most recent one
is for Prime Base (much larger module than the previous ones).
It takes them a long time to produce a module, but the quality of
thought that they put into it makes the wait worthwhile.  Their
distribution really stinks, at least in the Boston area.  It took
some searching to find a mail order company that could get Prime
Base for me.  In fact, poor distribution is probably why many
people think that the system is dead!

Now if I could just find more than one person willing to play it,
I could actually *use* the darn thing.

I played Morrow Project a few times; I sent off to Timeline (is that what
it's always been called?) for a list of their products and they sent me
back a wholesale order form - from the looks of it I could have (but never
did) ordered things at 'dealer cost'.  Maybe you TMP'ers out there could
try writing directly to them.
The group I used to play with really liked The Morrow Project, especially
its detailed combat system.  I borrowed its radiation stuff for my
Traveller campaign at the time.  Do they still run TMP at cons?

I used to have an Apple II(+) BASIC program that ran a menu-drive Morrow
Project combat helper for a GM.  You chose the various options:  weapon
type, range, weather, moving target, moving gunner, target size, etc.; all
of the options that were listed in the basic book.  I wonder if I could
dig that program up off an old disk...

First, GDW's much-vaunted "task" system. Anything you want to do, must be
defined as a task. You must roll 2D6 for it. If it's "simple", your roll must be
>=3. If it's "routine", roll>=7. If it's "difficult", roll>=11. And if it's
"formidable", roll>=15. You're allowed modifiers for one relevant skill and/or
one relevant attribute. GDW's excuse for that is "if you need more modifiers,
try splitting it up into several sub-tasks". And their attribute modifier is
stupid - characteristic/5. So, for example, we have firing a gun at a target at
moderate range. Task is routine, DM's are for Gun Combat skill and DEX.
If the gunman's DEX is 2, he gets a +0 modifier; if it's 12, he gets a +2.
Now DEX 2 is as low as you can get, which in "reality" means he's lucky if he's
still holding the gun - he probably dropped it 2 seconds after drawing it.
DEX 12 is as high as you can get without special effects, which means he can
draw the gun, fire a couple of accurate shots, twirl it on his little finger
and put it back in one smooth movement. In old Traveller, each type of gun had
its own DEX modifier. To fire a shotgun required less dexterity than to fire a
pistol, for example. And in old Traveller, you assigned DM's as you liked.

Next, the background. I have nothing against the general concept of the
"Shattered Imperium". But I snigger at GDW's attempt to explain why the Zhodani
aren't taking full advantage of it. Apparently, up to now they regarded the
Imperium as a threat; now the Spinward Marches are isolated, they're no longer
a threat, so they're left alone. Now, out of five Frontier Wars, how many were
started by the Zhodani, and how many by the Imperium? 5-0. Who's threatening
whom? And even if you did believe that, surely the Imperium will re-unite some
day. Better to get the Spinward Marches now, while there's a chance, and be
ready for that day.

Finally, the ship design system. I haven't tried it myself, but I hear from the
Traveller mailing list that it's extremely difficult to design ships at TL less
than 15. No wonder the Imperium's falling apart - what will their courier ships
do for maintenance?

Incidentally, for those who are interested, I've looked at the MT ship's weapon
tables, and copied a lot of the new stuff over to High Guard. I now have a set
of High Guard tables going up to TL16, and going up to TL21 will be no problem.
If you want a copy, or hints on how to do it, let me know.

Ah, but what makes you certain that they AREN'T taking advantage
of it?  Even the printed material suggests that this is their
"official" policy, while others out in the field have quite a
different idea.  Isn't it better to work behind the scenes at
keeping the Imperium in a shambles, rather than start another
Frontier War, giving them a common opponent and a reason to
reunite?  I know that's what MY Zhodani generals are up to....

I would very much be interested.. One of my on-going projects is a program 
that would manage starship design against the Traveller rules, both as a 
convinience to the players as well as a big help to the Referee.
