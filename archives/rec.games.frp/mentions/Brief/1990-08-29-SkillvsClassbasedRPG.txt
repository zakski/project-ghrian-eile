TITLE: Skill vs. Class based RPG's 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wednesday, 29 August 1990 18:43:06 UTC+1 - jhre...@uccs@ccnuccs.colorado.edu:
I like to start a discussion on "Skill based vs. Class based RPGs". 
My main reason to do this is that as a long time RPGer, (since 1977), 
I've pretty much played in, or ran every system out there. I started 
out with DnD, moved to Traveller, playtested, and later ran FTL 2448, 
Stalking the Night Fantastic, and Fringeworthy, acquired GURPS, and 
played several other systems. 
Each system that I've experienced was unique and had a different way 
of handling player characters, PC's. What I'm going to do now is 
discuss the merits and disadvantages of both class based and skill 
based sytems.

CLASS BASED
-----------

Class based systems assume that people fall into distinct groups or
"classes". Each class has their own set of skills and levels of 
experience within that class. The main assumption of the class based
systems is that when a person progresses to the next level of experience,
he progresses as everybody else does within his class, skill for skill,
ability for ability. He cannot branch out to other classes, without 
halting his progress in his original class.

Main assumption: The class is based on the average person in that area
                 and all abilities and skills are based on this average
                 person.

Benefits: It is much easier to start a character, you have definite goals
to shoot for, and, as long as you stay within the rules, your character
can be transfered to other campaigns within that system.

Disadvanages: It locks your character within a limited set of abilities,
you cannot easily branch out into other classes, and the rules decide how 
your character will progress within his class.

SKILL BASED
-----------

Skill based sytems assume people are individuals, and that they choose 
what skills and abilities they possess. Though two people perform the same
job, they may possess different skills at different levels. A person may
possess skills outside of his profession, or he may actually qualify for
more than one profession at a time. 

As a person gains experience, he applies it differently than others within
his same profession. Two people, in the same profession, who gain the same
amount of experience, will apply that experience differently.

Main assumption: Each and every character is an individual, and exeriences
                 the differently than those in a similar profession.

Benefits: Allows for highly individualized characters. Players can choose
which skill(s) their characters possess, and have the freedom to progress
in whichever skill they wish.

Disadvantages: Very intimidating to new players. Some versions require
lots of math to handle the skills. Character's don't transfer very well.

On the whole, I agree with your assessment of these, ah, classes of
RPGs.  However, I'd like to point out that there are also hybrid
systems, in which characters have individual skills, but the skills
are grouped into professions or "classes", which limit the characters'
choices somewhat.  I believe Warhammer works this way, and 1st-edition
Paranoia did as well, as do several "conventional" fantasy-genre systems.

I would like to take exception to your comment that characters in
class-based systems are more portable than in skill-based systems.  I
don't see this at all, and am wondering what experiences led you to
this conclusion.  In general, a character (from any sort of system)
should be portable between campaigns using the same game system if:

  1) The character adheres to the "standard" game system rules.  In
     AD&D, this also means no non-standard magic items.

  2) The character is "style-compatible" -- a role-playing,
     communications-oriented character won't port well to a
     "Monty-Haul" hack&slash game.  Strong differences in party
     power level can also be troublesome, but less so than style
     problems.

  3) The new campaign hasn't butchered the rule system to the point
     that "standard" characters aren't viable.

Frankly, I don't think well-developed characters are very portable in
any system -- they have too much investment in their game world, and
it's generally easier to start a new character with the appropriate
background than transport the character from universe X to universe Y,
which is bound to be somewhat traumatic....  Which isn't to say it
doesn't work, but I wouldn't recommend it as a routine thing.

        Portability is generally seen as beneficial.  Why?  How common
is it for a character to be transfered from one campaign into another,
unrelated campaign - to me 'unrelated' would mean that the new gm would
not have a *detailed* history of the character; i.e. wasn't around as a
player or gm during the character's previous exploits.
        I have seen this done once.  A player brought in a high level
priest and worked with the gm to set the character up as a pseudo-npc.
That seemed reasonable.  However, I don't think I would ever take one of
my characters into a new campaign or let a player bring one into a
campaign I was running unless the gm was intimately familiar with the
character's past.  To me, a pc's history is the most important part of
the character.  Unless the player has written a book on the subject, I
doubt that a gm could do a new character justice.

PC generation does take longer, but the resulting character is more satisfying,
( 'thou granted this can be a problem with NPC's so lots of pre-generated NPC's
are needed) and I've yet to see any system that requires more than simple 
arithmetic to handle skills.
Much more flexible than the traditional D&D class system.

However what about games like Role Master ? Where a skill based class system is
used. So characters are free to develope in anyway they want, but within the 
limitations of the class. ie a fighter can learn to cast spells, but it'll 
take him a long time to do so and he probably wont be very good at it.  


Just some thoughts.

Just a note:  Warhammer does attach certain skills to certain professions,
but you are not restricted to this system.  The skills attached to a 
profession only indicate what skills are appropriate or necessary to learn
to be an active member of that profession.  A character may learn any
skill that does not have a special prerequisite (eg, Cast Spells).  In
fact, many skills, especially specialist weapon skills, can *only* be
learned this way; that is, outside of any career or prefession.

I would like to disagree with those people (not Walter in
particular) who claim Warhammer is a class-based or hybrid system.  I 
think this is a misimpression given by not reading the rules thoroughly.
Since any character can learn 95% of the skills in Warhammer at any time,
regardless of his profession (magic skills excepted), Warhammer is most
definitely a skill-based system.

I neither agree or disagree.  However, he may be pointing out the 
difficulty a player can have when trying to capture the spirit of a
character when converting that character from system to system.

For instance, I had a RoleMaster game running, but we quickly tired of
RM's burdensome mechanics.  We knew we wanted to switch systems, but we
also knew we didn't want to use GURPS, which has a truly poor magic system.
[slam slam slam :)]  We opted for Hero 4, since, we thought, we could
easily convert the RM characters to this system.  This proved a nightmare.

First, it was very hard to duplicate some of the RM Runemaster's powers
under Hero *AND* give the character the same functionality he had under RM.
[ I don't mean to say that only the Runemaster gave us problems; all RM
magic using characters were hard to replicate under Hero. ]

Second, although these were very low level characters, they *could not*
be created at the Hero 75/75 level.  These 1st and 2nd level RM characters
came out to be 200-300 pt Hero characters, and much of the flavor imparted
by RM was lost, very very much to our dismay.

Please note that I also instructed the players not to try to convert
*everything*, but rather to capture the essence of the character under
the new system.

Now, on the other hand, if I were to convert a AD&D character to Hero, 
I think I could easily do it (AD&D characters being fairly narrowly
defined) and in a reasonable number of points.

So, perhaps, this is what the original poster was trying to point out.

Friday, 31 August 1990 22:57:08 UTC+1 - Homer Dired:
Concerning NPCs with skill-based games.
In GURPS, which alongside Call of Cthulhu are the only skill-based games
I have spent much time running, I have never had much a problem making NPCs.

The reson is that instead of designing an NPC to be like a character, design
it like an NPC. get a good idea of what kind of skills he/she would have,
and then simply give a number. The only real problem are figuring Move,
etc., but its no more than, say, determining encumbrance in a class-based
game. 

Those NPCs who might actually be see again can be fleshed out more as
is necessary. Don't worry about points, since once you have some feel of how
the game works its pretty easy to know what kind of stat-skill combo is
necessary. 

In DnD you gotta know Con, Str, Dex, maybe Charisma, and maybe Wisdom. 
And magic items? Anybody ever really figure out just what a 7th level character
should have? Rolling tends to create weird results, and once you start to think
you've already invested time in the NPC.

I guess the point is that from a role-playing point of view, if you start 
with the question "What is this character logically capable of?", then 
assigning skills is easy -- it's just a matter of being familiar with the 
system. Classes perhaps make this easier, but seems to have this tendency to
produce cardboard cut-outs. But if you're going to grind out 6 stats, an xp
total, logical equipment, logical magic items, roll or assign hit points,
determine armor class, to-hit adjustments and damage adjustments (unless for
some reason you decide that everyone in the world has 12s across the board),
how much time have you saved? It's almost like one of those offensive AT&T
commercials. You know "Where's my big savings?"...

Friday, 31 August 1990 23:32:56 UTC+1 - S. Gwen Johnson:
I find a combination of skills and classes to be good.  If someone is
a fighter for example, then as he learns one skill in fighting, he also
learns things that can be transferred to other combat skills. So if he
goes up levels, then he will get slightly better at skills he hasn't
studied, but the main skill to which he devotes his attention will be
significantly better than the other combat skills.  This seems to
follow pretty much.  If you study one style of karate, then picking up
different weapon forms in that style is pretty easy, picking up a
different style ofkarate is almost as easy, picking up fencing or
something is less easy, but easier for a martial artist than a real
neophyte.  
Another thing I like is giving characters skills and bonuses based on
their background.  If you grew up in a pirate family, the mere fact
you've been around boats means that while you may have not studied them
specifically, you're still going to have a better idea how to sail one
than some landlubber.  If you want to be a *good* sailor, you'll take
that skill and study it.  But you don't have to.

Class systems can be flexible.  For example, instead of saying, "All
fighters get sword and shield"  The class can say, "Fighters get their
choice of any two combat skills."  In this way, fighters in a class
system can be very different from one another with one an axe user and
another and archer.  

Class systems have an advantage in that they reward good character
concept.  Generally speaking, class systems are built to make it
easier to have a bunch of skills grouped together as a "package deal".
This is a way of rewarding a person for having a coherent character
concept.  Of course, if a player has a coherent concept that's not
part of one of the packages, then the GM ought to give him the same
benefits.  But on the other hand, the player who wants to be a
fighter-assassin-theif-magic-user-cleric-monk shouldn't get any such bonus.
If they want it, let'em work for it, one skill at a time.

My experience with portability is with DnD. I ran and played in several
campaigns that were informally "linked-up" via trans-dimensional portals. Each
world had its own rules regarding magic, spells, and firearms. The fact that
your character was generated on Scorch, and moved to Ishmaladie, both of which
had very different house rules, (Scorch was techno oriented, while Ishmaladie
was more standard DnD). The fact that the character was based somewhat on the
basic DnD rules, he could be transported to other worlds with little fixing.

Ahem, to belabor the obvious, a character is more than a set of stats and
weapons. If *you* the player are a good roleplayer, then you don't need a book
on your character. Besides the situation that I'm talking about is a shared
multiverse. Having a set of standards to character construction, helps loads
when your character goes dimension hopping.

>                                                 Jeff Stehman

My experience with GURPS has been that the characters are not very portable,
despite the company's hype. Now I'm not saying that you can't 'port a character
from within *one* GM's campaign to another of his, but that characters are not
very portable between two or more GMs. Each have their own method of character
creation, how many points can be spent, number of disad's, etc. You have to
carefully scruntinize a GURPS character from another campaign before you let
him into yours.

Saturday, 1 September 1990 03:48:39 UTC+1 - Dan Schaeffer:
I've been watching this thread for a while, and finally decided to put in
a couple of cents' worth.
I've been running a game for some years which some friends of mine
wrote.  It is a mixed skills-classes game: there are specific classes,
such as warrior, thief, martial artist, priest, and a couple distinct
types of mages.  A player chooses a class, and then tailors skills to
fit his or her character conception.  Different classes have some skills
that are restricted to that class; for example, some skills can only be
learned by thieves.  Other skills are general, and may be learned by
anyone.

The system is far from rigid, except as far as magic goes.  Even there,
however, there is room to move around.  In the original version of the
game, no nonmage can learn magic spells.  (Priests are a different matter.)
Also, the distinct classes of mage have different spell lists.  In *my*
version of the game, magic is defined differently, and anyone can learn
it; but unless one has devoted one's life to knowing magic, it is much
more difficult to learn and to use.  Also, instead of different mage
types, I allow each mage to be unique by having players develop their
own spell lists.  The idea is to have "theme mages" -- e.g., fire mages,
nature mages, even (an NPC) a time mage.  As long as they can come up
with a logical progression of spells from simpler to more complex, the
players can do just about anything.

The hard thing about this system is, of course, that it takes a lot of
time to develop a mage.  There have been very few completely defined
mage NPC's, because I don't have time to build them from scratch.  Still,
I can usually come up with a decent quickie if I need one; and magic is
scarce anyway in my universe, so it's not all that necessary.

Anyway, I think skills make a lot of sense, and I like the GURPS and
Hero systems.  Yes, they may be a bit complex for new gamers, but for
an experienced group, especially one which values "realism," skill-
based systems are more playable than plain AD&D.

True enough...  From what I've seen, the best set-ups for dealing with
the problems of PC/NPC generation tend to be games in which not many
PC/NPCs are needed (Champions, for example) and games with plenty of
PC/NPC templates provided for you (Shadowrun Archetypes, for example).

As far as simple math goes, admittedly, few games that I have seen
require much more than basic algebra.  However, the sheer number of
numbers that become involved could be intimidating to the
non-mathematically inclined.  Role Master, Champions, and Villians &
Vigilantes come to mind.  Ever see the formula for Carrying Capacity in
V&V?  It goes something like this:

(((S/10)^3)+(E/10))*(Weight/50, round up), round up

Ugh...  I dunno...  Role Master takes forever to generate characters --
and none of the ICE NPCs that I have seen published have anything near
the depth that *I* would need to see them as anything other than grunts,
regardless of their role in the adventure.  Give me the detail of
Champions or RuneQuest supplements anyday.  Too many classes, as well...
especially if any of the Companion rules come into play.

That's partially due to the vagueness of Hero.  It's much easier in a
"fixed" system to designate what IS important and what isn't important. 
It's much harder to make that designation (in terms of cost) when the
system will allow for virtually anything.

To answer the first: yes. I believe Star Frontiers used classes. Top Secret
as well. Space Master and CyberSpace by ICE are both hybrid class/skill
systems in the SF genre. Palladium's Rifts is class/skill. 

The bonus question: 
FRP games were dominated by D&D in the early years of their development. The
only non-fantasy genre game of any consequence was Traveller, which invented
the concept of skills in RPGs. Runequest was the first skill-based fantasy
game, but time has pretty much reduced the original Runequest to a mere
footnote in RPG history. (How many people have heard of it today? Not many,
even though it is of very high quality (at least the 2nd edition was)).

So while fantasy games were rip-roarin' in the late 70s, it wasn't until
the early 80s that SF and other genres really got into full swing. And, at
that time, skill based games were beginning their rise to predominance. Thus
it's only natural that most non-fantasy genre games employ skill systems.

(As a footnote, has anyone looked at wargame review books published around
1980? Most of the had an RPG review section. One of these books, _The Compete
Book of Wargames_, had a review of "Superhero 2044" by Gamescience (?). It
apparently wasn't spectacular. The review expressed doubts that the super-
hero genre was a viable one for role-playing. If I only had a time machine...)

No, that was not it at all.  Many times it was quite obvious *how* a RM power
would appear under Hero.  However, Hero might make the power completely
impossible or horribly expensive to buy.

Nevertheless, Hero appears to be one of our games of choice, alongside
Warhammer FRP and possibly Torg.

Hmmm... I haven't noticed any GURPS GMs who vary the "standard"
character generation process much.  100-point characters with -40
points in disads and -5 in quirks are pretty standard in my
experience, which covers quite a few GURPS GMs.  I do have a few
"house rules" in regards to disliking certain disads in my campaign,
or attempts at crocking the character generation process.  But I think
most characters except the most 2-dimensional would pass these fairly
easily.

A few advantages and disadvantages are game world-specific (Patrons,
Enemies, and Dependents come to mind).  If these other people don't
come along for the ride, it's something of a problems -- either the
character will have to buy them off, or find some sort of local
equivalent.  Those are the only obvious things I can think of that
don't port well (assuming the character is staying in the same basic
genre).

In general, I'm going to scrutinize *any* character who's entering my
campaign -- characters should fit into the GM's world, after all.  I
may not want a character from another campaign in my game because of
the conception I have of my universe (I don't want people bopping all
around the multiverse).  But that has nothing to do with the system --
that's equally much of a problem in AD&D.

Perhaps GURPS characters are less transportable than AD&D ones because
the type of people who GM GURPS create more idiosyncratic worlds, and
GURPS characters tend to be more coupled into their particular home
campaigns... I don't know.  But it's not the system, it's the GMs
involved, I'm pretty sure.

I would consider Traveller to be class-based, in a way, since skills
were specific to a particular career path, and there wasn't much
opportunity to learn new skills outside of the (pre-game) career.
However, the game mechanics worked exclusively from the skills, not
the careers.

I guess you could say it was a skill-based system with class-based
character generation.

Here is a list of what I could come up with just off the top of my head:
        Flashing Blades (still sort of fantasy)
        Space Opera (somewhat class oriented)
        CyberPunk
        CyberSpace 
        Space Master
        ShadowRun (if you don't build your own archetypes)
        Star Wars (again if you don't build your own archetypes)

Furthermore there are lots of games which are profession based but still allow
you to pick some skills that you want:
        Anything by GDW (Traveller, Mega, 2300, T2000)
        Other Suns
        RingWorld
        Call of Cthulhu

You get the idea.  This is an intriguing thread, any others people can think of?

        You need to do this with any system.  With GURPS you need to do so
less than with many others.  Things you need to check for are total points.
In range for your campaign?  Any non-standard items (this is not a system
flaw). Wealth level (this affects high-tech campaigns or ones where it
is easy to buy magic items).  Literacy is handled differently depending 
on whether most people can read or not. For GURPS Cyberpunk things are
complicated because GMs are allowed to NOT charge points for cybertech
hardware.  Personally I always charge points to ensure portability. 
If a GM charges points they are listed on the character sheet and they
can easily be disregarded.  If not then the transported character needs
to be scrutinized and charged the appropriate number of points.

The two places where you have portability problems are Supers and Cyberpunk.
Both are Loyd Blankenship projects.  GURPS Fantasy Folk characters and
GURPS Aliens characters may have a few minor transport problems also 
due to the influence of GURPS Supers.  Also the value of having the
advantages that affect aging is highly setting dependent.  In most
campaigns Longevity, Undying, Unaging, and Immortality are overpriced.
Most GMs game in a linear fashion so that game time rarely spans more
than a decade.  if a GM uses a 'time jump' method where the next adventure
starts 10 years later or there are frequent multi-month/year gaps between
adventures in game time than the listed costs are reasonable.

  The amount of points for a "standard" GURPS campaign varies with the
genre.  Recently SJ Games has come to the realization that one-size
fits all for point cost isn't realistic.  Here are the standard GURPS
points by genre:

        1. Fantasy - 100-points. -40 disads, -5 quirks.  When in doubt
                      use this.
        2. Special Ops - 300 points, -40 disads, -5 quirks.  Only 80
                         points may be spent on attributes.  These
                         are normal very high skilled and trained
                         humans not supers.
        3. Cyberpunk - 200 points, -40 disads, -5 quirks.
                       150 if you want the PCs to have a really difficult
                       time. 250 if you want characters with a 'rep'.

        4. Supers -  500 points, -100 disads for a traditional comic super.
                     250 points, -100 disads for a "realistic" campaign.

Point levels for characters depends on the genre the GM wants to use and 
the power level desired.

at a character who comes in with the same 150 points especially if this
character started close to 150 points.  There is a problem with game

This is easier to do as you get more points.  I definitely look closely
at characters who have attributes exceeding 14.  I discourage 17s and
18s except in "power" campaigns (Supers, Conan, immortals, and such).

Yes for the most part this is true.  If both GMs use the same genre
and the same starting point levels then usually characters should 
be very transportable.  Characters are less transportable between
genres because the skills tend to be different.  Although if you
look at GURPS Riverworld you can find an example where various 
genres mix (though no magic) where the characters are all initially
equalized due to the setting.

I think an important distinction is to be made between systems which
use classes, professions, or templates only during the character creation
phase and those which also use them for character development. I think
that if you use the second idea as the determining factor, the above
list would be cut down severely. The original version of Traveller,
lacking any sort of character improvement system, is a moot point, but
I think Flashing Blades is mainly (entirely?) skill-oriented as far as
development is concerned. And I would be very surprised if Ringworld
or CoC, both Chaosium products, used professions that are
significantly "harder" than those in Runequest.

The point, which I was hoping someone would pick up on, is that
non-fantasy systems are much less likely to employ classes because
they were created in isolation from the conceptual framework developed
in D&D.

There are occasional player characters who seem much more portable
than others, for reasons which generally have nothing to do with the
game system.  I played an orc-breed woman warrior, Kasta, who was the
target of a vicious series of dream-sendings by an evil spirit.  Though
she didn't break, as it had hoped, she did develop a very odd world-
view.  She knew she couldn't tell Dreamsender's visions from reality, and 
eventually came to accept this; she decided to treat whatever was
happening to her at the moment as 'real', whether it made sense or not,
whether it fit with what had happened before or not.

I got to play Kasta in a convention game of Glenn Thain's, a different
system and drastically different world, and she did fine.  She was
fascinated by what was going on, and learned from it--the differences
didn't bother her at all.

I find that ordinary, sane characters, on the other hand, are often
destroyed by being pulled from one campaign to another.  They lose
their roots in reality and turn into dry, shrivelled caricatures.  In
general, if I want a character similar to an old one, I try to find a
new conception that embodies the same general idea but is part of the
new world and its culture.

The worst problem I have ever seen with transferring characters from

come and go but the character goes on and on.
Once you get into this mindset, self-sacrifice and strong PC attachments
to the world--national loyalty, love, comradeship with NPCs--become
more or less impossible, and the game suffers.  I quit taking PCs
adapted from other campaigns, no matter how good the conversion, after
a few experiences of this.

For conventions and other one-shot runs it may be okay, because there's
no time to develop strong attachments anyway.  For campaigns, new
characters are probably best.  So I don't care much about portability.

Star Wars "classes" (and I presume Shadowrun's) are CHARACTERISTIC
determinants,  not skill determinants.  A "tongue-tied engineer" has an
aptitude for mechanical skills,  just as an AD&D character with an 18
strength has an aptitude for combat.  However,  that "engineer" could
be training his combat or perception skills.

Perhaps we need to define class-based and skill-based,  and I submit the
following as a basis for people to work with:

Class-based:  initial skill levels are determined by a chosen profession
(generally from a fixed set of same),  and skill advances beyond that base
are determined by that initial profession regardless of the character's
actions.

An purely class-based would be characterized by being able to characterize
a PC's skills using a very limited set of statistics,  such as race,  sex,
and innate physical and mental statistics.  AD&DV1 is thus not a pure
class-based system due to its proficiencies system.


Skill-based:  initial skills are determined by simulating the character's
previous training,  and skill advances beyond that base are determined by
the character's actions.


Skill-based systems might be described as the root system,  and class-based
systems impose some overlying structure on top to simulate both the
nature of the game world and unspecified skills,  as well as to simplify
the system.  In the case of systems like AD&DV1,  the overlying system
does not work with any concept of there being an underlying system.
Thus attempts to modify the upper-level are rather arbitrary and have
difficulty satisfying people's concept of game balance.  Games like Rolemaster
attempt to build the lower-level from the structure of the upper level,
and thus the various classes are again rather arbitrary in their points
assignment.  Games like Warhammer,  or RuneQuest when the occupations
system is being used for character generation,  use the underlying system
to build a logical upper level.  This upper level is thus easy to add to.
(Note that RuneQuest is rather weak here,  actually;  they oversimplify
how the advancement system works,  and damage the character generation
system in the process.)

It depends on what you mean by "class-based".  Certainly, when you generate a
character you either choose one of a large number of templates (a.k.a. classes)
or invent your own.  But after that, it's skills all the way.  In AD&D, your
chance of success in, say, hitting someone depends on whether your character
is a Fighter, a Mage, etc.  In Star Wars, it depends on your Blaster skill.
It makes no difference if the character is a Bounty Hunter with Blaster 6D,
a Gambler with Blaster 6D, or an elite Imperial trooper with Blaster 6D.
Liksewise, when it comes to using experience points (known here as Skill
Points) to boost those skills, it is irrelevant what type of character is
trying to increase that Blaster skill - it takes 6 points for all of them.
Character generation is class-based; everything else is skill-based.

[regarding Shadowrun & Star Wars]


Not so fast.  Shadowrun and Star Wars, for the most part, do not exhibit the
hallmark of class-based systems:  the acquisition of ability based entirely
and solely on one's class.

The exceptions are (as they usually are) the handling of paranormal abilities.

However, I would still argue that neither SR or SW is truly class-based since
they break the other hallmark of class systems:  character must (semi-)
rigidly adhere to the abilities and principles of their class.

Although abilities are granted in a class style to SR mages and SW jedi, any
character properly role-played can acquire these skills/abilities.

I'd sure like to know how you figure this.  Skills in Shadowrun are not based on
some idea of class level.  Just because Shadowrun gives you templates for 
characters doesn't mean it is class-based.

    I am not sure about this one.  Although it is ostensibly class-based,
    in practice all that membership of a given class means is that some
    skills are easier to learn than others.  So this is really a skill
    system with cost weightings for learining skills.
    It works quite well with Rolemaster .... :-)

Though I've never read, or played Shadowrun, if it uses templates to define
what skills are available to the character in his chosen profession, then it is
skill based, unless, it determines the amount of skill points that are
available to the character by his level. Example of this is Tri Tac's series of
games; FTL 2448, Fringeworthy, and Stalking the Night Fantastic. All these
games are mix between skill and class based. Characters pick and choose their
skills, but only can increase them by advancing in levels. Each level gives
more hitpoints, skill points, and pyschic/magic energy. The system is sort of a
cross between skill based and class based. When I talked to the author of these
games, he said that he believes that a playere needs some sort of reward or
sign of reward for his efforts, and that going up in levels is the best way. I
countered that he can feel satisfaction in his character by simply totaling up
his experience points, and that the level system's granting more hitpoints
doesn't make much sense considering the deadliness of the combat system.

I came up with an alternate experience system, which I will present in another
posting.

On the subject of SFRPG's that use a class based system, the only *true* class
based SFRPG that I remember is _Starships and Spacemen_. Basically it was a
Trek ripoff, with races and character classes like science officer, engineer,
command, etc. Does anyone lse remember this game?

  Its true, having templates does not making a class-based system.  Fantasy
Hero does this, it simply makes it easier to put an idea into action.  And 
gives a good idea of what disadvantages would be good without crippling a 
character who wants to play a "type" of adventurer.

What circularity?  I started with two independent premises which I
think are self-evident, and neither of which derives from the other or
from the conclusion.

The first premise is that character portability is inversely
proportional to the originality of the source and target campaigns,
which is obvious.  The second premise is that campaign quality is
proportional to originality, which again is obvious.  For there to be a
circularity, either of these premises would have to be derived from the
conclusion; neither one is.

An example of a circular argument is that the Bible is true because it
says it's true, and it couldn't be lying about that.  The premise --
the Bible says it's true and the Bible must be telling the truth when
it says that -- is derived from the conclusion -- the Bible is true.

Methinks a basic logic refresher would be in order for jdnicoll....

I disagree with your second premise.  I can could create a totally original
(and confusing) game system which would be totally lacking in quality.
At other times, originality is a matter of who get into the genre first
(or at least, that's what the gaming companies believe).

Oh, excuse me.  You didn't claim your statement was obviously correct, but
merely obvious.  I apologize for my misunderstanding.

It is?  Character portability is mainly dependent on the difference between
two campaigns--thus portability between a fantasy and a SF game is rather
limited (actually, a SF game where you could successfully port in fantasy
characters might be quite interesting--but I digress).  Character histories
are portable to a variable degree--generally, if one or the other game has
an extensively defined history character histories won't be portable.  However,
absence of such a history for the game, or using a prepublished history, doesn't
preclude an original campaign.  There are good star trek books (if not very 
many).  Character histories will usually require editing, and in most cases I
am not in favor of translating characters between games, but it is quite
possible to have an original game which includes characters from other games,
and quit common to have boring games with no characters from other games.


>The second premise is that campaign quality is proportional to originality, 
>which again is obvious.
Again, it is?  Campaign quality is not dependent on the originality of your
ingredients, it is dependent on what is done with those ingredients.  A
campaign can be really original, and still be lousy; on the other hand, an
extremely generic campaign can be good.

What I disagree with is that you state that portability is an inverse
realtionship with regards to character originallity. I've many original
characters who've ported over to other campaigns quite easily. Of course they
missed their home world, though sometimes, the gate betwixt the two is two-way,
they still can't get back. It's in how you play your character, not in how you
write him.

The Archetype character generation mechanism that Shadowrun has is a
method of speeding up character design for people who want to slap
together a character quickly to get into a game. They are essentially
pregenerated characters that have a limited number of variations that
can be made to them. You can make your own Archetypes; what they consist
of is a decision on how to divide 10 points in a 4/3/2/1/0 pattern
among the categories of Race, Characteristics, Skills, Tech/Spells, and
Magic. Once you've done that, then, based on how many points you put in
each category, you have _X_ number of points to allocate to your
characteristics, _Y_ number of points of skills, _Z_ nuyen worth of
equipment, and _N_ points worth of spells if you put enough points in
Magic to be a mage. Which skills you pick tends to depend on the kind
of character you're building, but there's nothing preventing any
character from picking up any given skill (although some choices are
rather stupid in game terms; how often do you expect an Essence 0.2
razorboy full of optionware to get anything useful out of having a
Sorcery skill, chummer?). Later, if you want to create another
character of the same type, you go back to that Archetype and shuffle
some of the characteristics, skills, equipment, and spells around, and
you have your new character.

Skills are increased, and new skills are gained, by spending Karma
(analogous to experience points, but they have other uses as well).
Again, the choice of skills is up to the player, not fixed by
points

Wait a minute, here. What exactly do you mean by properly role played?  Do you
mean that if a player plays the nuances of his character well, you will allow 
him to gather paranormal abilities as a reward?  You probably mean that a 
character can, during the course of play, decide to change his mind and
pursue another career, am I right?  In this case, all the character is doing
is changing classes, isn't he?  It seems to me that this thread is getting
really ridiculously nitpicky.

Good skill based games such as Hero and 
RuneQuest are class based as well in that in order to pick up a new skill, the
character must train in it.  This often means finding a professional and 
signing on as an apprentice, ie. starting a new profession.

Likewise, class based
games are often skill based to a certain extent, in that friends tend to share
their skills with each other, regardless of their professions.

Of course, neither case is true in the extremes, but extremes, as always, tend
towards the ridiculous.  Extreme skill based games allow characters to pick
up skills willy nilly with no thought to the hows and wherefores of learning,
while extreme class based games severly limit the true flexibility of the 
human mind and talent for jack-of-all-tradesmanship.

Most, if not all, games on the modern market tend to fall somewhere in       
between these two extremes.  Good GM's will usually tend to seek the golden
mean on this issue as well because it is the most 'realistic'.  It is also the
stance that, in the end, is the most enjoyable, fulfilling, and playable.
People should not be allowed to pick up skills here there and everywhere with
no rhyme or reason, but neither should they be prevented from picking up the
odd trick here and there with the time that is not occupied with their
profession.

The ancient excuse that magic-users spend too much time on their magic to 
properly learn other skills is hogwash.  I have never seen an adventuring party
containing a magic user like this - indeed I don't think such a beast would be
suited for the adventuring life.  The excuse is merely a rationalization for
an overpowerful magic system that would allow mu's to unbalance the game if
everyone were allowed to cross train.

  You missed it ... They're only class based if you take them directly as
archetypes. Unless the classes go like this:

  Dwarf, Elf, Human, Orc, Troll, people with guns, people with bigger guns,
people with magic, people with more magic, poeple with different magic, people
with lots of skills, people with massive physical and mental attributes, people
with good attributes and fairly large guns, people with magic and fairly big
guns, people with cyberware, people with cyberware and guns, people with
cyberware and magic, people with cyberware and magic and guns, people who go to
bars, and people who stay home!

  I guess you're right, it must be class based. Just look at the majorly
limited selection of characters you could chose from ...

Did Tim say this?  I thought he was speaking in general.  (He has this
equation and all in a previous article.)  I can make an original and
crappy campaign too, you know.  (How about an RPG where you play a tribble
on a Klingon planet?  Or "Ringworld of Cthulhu"?)

The gaining of such skills is a game world limitation,  not a rules
limitation.  If the character can find a teacher,  He can learn the skills.
(I dislike SW Jedi rules,  because the neophyte learner gets a big edge
over a character that started out as a Jedi.)

He's changing professions,  or changing schools.  Only in class-based
systems does the rules system have to be involved.

The above is the essential difference.  If you don't find the above
difference important,  then hit 'k'.

Profession != class.  Teacher != class.

How much is involved in changing a class in D&D?  Your saving throws change,
you get some new proficiencies,  you learn some base amount of skills in
your new profession.  There are only a limited number of classes you can
switch to,  and only humans can switch classes.

The limitations on characters in RuneQuest,  for example,  is finding a
teacher -- which is a gameworld limit,  not a rules limit.  It is the
source of this limitation that is vital.

The limitation on a gnome thief becoming an illusionist,  on the other
hand,  is a rules limit.

Now that's true.

Given free access to the right teachers,  a RuneQuest character could
learn anything.  The limitation is totally imposed by the game world,
not the system.

You don't need the rules system to impose this limit,  you need a realistic
world.  D&D and class-based games impose limits on the characters via
the rules system,  which is the least realistic way to do things.

If I tried to learn to play jai-alai well,  would I hear a mysterious voice
saying "no,  you're a level 4 computer hacker,  you can't do that",
or in playing jai-alai,  would I then be prohibited from learning more
computer science?  Only if I lived in a class-based world.

- show quoted text ->        You just made Rolemaster and WFRP class-based.
Rolemaster is clearly class-based.  It has an underlying skills system,
but one's learning rate is modified by the amount of previous experience
at everything and by a class "characteristic", and skills are learned en
masse when you go up a level.  You also get the level increase bonuses
when you go up levels,  and that amount of increase is based on your class.

(Rolemaster is also the biggest exercise in probability-playing known to
man:  I remember doing some serious probability calculations to determine
how many points to put into getting a skill list.  [I wanted the maximum
amount of points left over that I could put into useless secondary skills.])

WFRP has taken professions and made them part of the rules system,  thus
"classing" them.  From what I've seen of WFRP,  the profession system
could be removed without much difficulty,  and new professions created at
the drop of a hat.

I view the skill-based/class-based difference as really being a class-based/
non-class-based difference.  All roleplaying games (at least,  as far as I
am aware of them) have skills in one form or another -- even D&D in the
three white books.  It is the presence or absence of a rules-based class
system that is really the issue.

One could easily take a purely skills-based system -- GURPS,  RuneQuest,
Fantasy Hero -- and add a class system on top of it.  You would have a
heck of a time doing the same thing to D&D.

Woah ... hold on a minute there, pardnur.  I don't think that the major

The number of classes a character can choose from could be as varied as the
GM wants, it could be as varied as the number of jobs that are available!

Perhaps this thread should spend some effort defining what class based and skill
based systems are before argument as to merit - there seem to be a lot of people
who have differing opions as to definitions.

I don't know any games system that advocates enforcement of the rules by 
appearances of mysterious voices.  Rules are meant simply to model reality, and
in that sense, classes are to a certain extent professions.  Most extreme class
based systems are set up with the presumption that cross training is not allowed
because of the time invovled.  While you may be able to pick up a small amount
of ability in disparate skills (such as hacking and jai-alai), the time 
dedication to the two different areas may preclude you from being great in
either one.
Just ask closet writers with full time jobs how hard it is to finish that
novel for example.  D&D ( as far as I can remember ) is one of those games that
says that the professions (classes) exclude others because of the amount of
training needed to become expert in the required abilities of the profession.

You are right that the difference between a true profession and its model the
class, is that the class divisions tend to confer other abilities on the 
individual, such as Saving Throws and so on.  Well designed game systems, 
however, tend to base such extra abilities as little upon profession as 
possible, and as much on experience, physical/mental makeup and so on.  That
is not to say that one's profession cannot affect one's character physically and
mentally, only that it should not be the only determining factor.

Limiting 'class switching' in a game system is presumably meant to model
social attitudes (ie Gnomes just don't become Illusionists in the same way that
17th century British humans did not become actors in the Noh theatre.).  This
may be fine if you are playing a game that attempts to model a world complete
with social and political background ( warhammer and CoC) but these rules do
not really translate all that well when someone tries to design their own 
campaign environment.  It is better in these cases to use a system that is
designed to be flexible - ie. to model any number of cultural environments - a
number of these games exist (rolemaster to a degree, HERO, Gurps, Runequest to
a degree).

Excuse me, but do you really think that inappropriate juxtapositions of
two other people's ideas are "original"?  Perhaps the difficulty in
communication arises from the fact that you don't know what originality
is.

Reminds me of the time on rec.arts.sf-lovers where someone was blasting

I disagree.  Many other games have the look of class based games but still have
a very workable skill system.  Rolemaster, C&S, Bushido, Space Opera, Flashing
Blades, Powers and Perils, Buck Rogers (TSR) are the few that I can think of
off the top of my head.  I would imagine that the same thing could be done 
with D&D without too much effort, in fact many homebrew versions of the game
I have seen have done just that - add a skill system.  The thing is, however,
that TSR does not WANT to do this.  Likely because they feel it would disrupt 
the balance of their existing system (this may or may not be true).

I tried doing this before,  but I may have changed my opinions somewhat,
so here are the official Andrew Bell definitions:

SKILL-BASED VERSUS CLASS-BASED:

The skill-based versus class-based dichotomy is a false one.  A system can
be completely class-based,  yet use a straightforward skill system for its
mechanics.  The true dichotomy is class-based versus non-class-based,  and
these are merely the extreme points on a continuum.

The characteristic of a purely class-based system is that a character
improves solely based on his/her class,  regardless of what actions the
character takes.  An example of this might be a D&D thief who gets into a
fight versus one that breaks into a bank and loots the contents;  the
fight and the heist will have the same effect on his/her skills.  The
character goes up in thieving skills regardless.  In cases where the
character acts in a manner judged (by the class system) to be completely
inappropriate for the character's class,  either he/she is prevented
from so doing ("You can't pick up a shield,  you're a mage!")  or he/she
gets no experience for that adventure.

In a non-class-based system,  on the other hand,  the character's
improvements are either based on actions (for example,  RuneQuest skill
checks) or on the character's choice of what to train.  Any limitations
imposed on what the character can learn are imposed by the gameworld
"reality;"  characters may be unable to find teachers for the skills
they want,  or may not have the talent to learn particular skills,  but
the game system itself imposes no limitations on what training is
available to a particular character.
    One might argue that games like AD&D simply have lots of these talent
limitations that make characters unable to learn certain skills.  However,
since a thief can improve his/her fighting,  he/she obviously does not
have a mental block against it.  Moreover,  the dual-class system implies
the non-existence of such limits for human characters at least.

* Initial items are determined by "class."

** Certain characteristics are determined by original profession,  like
  "Very strong",  I believe.

  class-like,  they have another which isn't.  The class-like one makes
  character generation very quick.

**** The existence of weapon specialization makes V1 not absolutely class-

As far as I know,  no games currently sold are absolutely class-based.
There are a number of games that are non-class-based.

Whoops!  Wrong reversal:  you would have a heck of a time converting any
form of D&D to a *non-class-based* system.

>I disagree.

And a good thing too,  since it is wrong.


> Many other games have the look of class based games but still have
>a very workable skill system.
Quite true.  You could easily describe "skills" in D&D* in the same fashion,
instead of multiple different fashions.  You would need the occasional
special case -- for example,  fighting skills give multiple uses per
round to higher level fighters -- but the majority of it could be defined
via a skills system.  You could also convert the current non-weapon
proficiencies into additional skills.

What you cannot do without major hacking that would completely change the
nature of the game is separate the class system from the experience system.

>in fact many homebrew versions of [D&D]

>I have seen have done just that - add a skill system.  The thing is, however,
>that TSR does not WANT to do this.  Likely because they feel it would disrupt 
>the balance of their existing system (this may or may not be true).
It would change almost its entire nature.  One could unify the skills system
in D&D fairly easily,  but the same is not true of changing the experience
system.

Class-based systems do have a certain advantage.  It is very easy to create
the basics of a character:  roll some stats,  choose a class,  and a race,
and you've done 95% of what's important for playing that character (with the
exception of wizard types,  who need to determine what spells they have.)
This simplicity can be a virtue.  My only surprise is that they didn't try
to make it even more of a virtue in version 2,  where they could have made
a more unified skills system.
   They could have made the thieving skills part of the non-weapon
proficiencies system,  and created a warrior-rogue continuum.  Bards would
get fewer proficiencies because they have their singing to work on,  or
bardic skills could require a lot of proficiency slots as would fighting
skill.  Rangers would be fighters who put proficiencies into hiding (rural)
and sneaking(rural),  and Paladins would be devotees of a particular
church who are rewarded by their god for living a particular lifestyle.


* The reason I talk of D&D is that it is the most class-based system that
I know of.  I personally prefer non-class-based games because  my playing
style is suited for those types of games.  I can certainly see how people
might want to play in a system with the advantages of a class-based
system,  and I am not intending to use the phrase "class-based" with any
perjorative intent.

So true, so true.  But if I really knew how to create original games I'd be
in the gaming industry and not in pounding away at this crappy, obsolete
terminal.  (As an aside, there is a tendency in game publishing to view
originality in terms of being first to file at the patent office, to use an
analogy.  And yes, I know US patent offices don't work that way.)  Well, I
did deliver on my promise of crap at least.

no, that's the wrong approach anyway. what you would need to do would be to
modify the experience system. this can be done with only minor hacking.
this is the idea that gamma world, and i think a few other games use:
 experience points are awarded by the gm for experiential activities (picking
locks, using skills, fighting, etc.). rather than character progression given
on a table, where all character's of the same level have the same skills (and
this has been relieved in ad&d2), where exp are cumulative and, concievably,
limitless, the characters spend exp to go up in the proficiencies etc, that
they want. (is this gurps as well?)

for example in _d&d, for a mage to get to 2nd level, the ph1 says he needs 2500
exp. accumulated. for a more "class-diffused" system, you might make the exp
necessary 1500. the player could spend those points to raise the character's
fighting and certain other abilities/skills/proficiencies that are basic to
_all_ characters, whether of his class or not. any other "non-common" skills/
proficiencies would cost extra points. this could concievably allow a to be
able to fire off some 5th-level spells, but still not be able to fight worth a
damn (fighting at 1st or 2nd level). however, this being so tremendously
disadvantageous to the character, the player will want to keep the two
dimensions close to each other. 

this idea (as applied to d&d) has only just occurred to me as i read this
thread. it's one i will work on and very likely post when i'm done (i'd say by
halloween). does anyone have any comments, or notes about something i may have
overlooked, points i've missed, etc.?

But then, you run into people who are "JOATs" that is "jack of all trades", who
are very good at most of what they do. How do you explain a person like Isaac
Asimov, who can write intelligently about anything? The other type is the
Renissance (sp?) Man. Here is a person who was well versed in multiple fields
of science and learning. Neither of those two match the limitations you have
listed above.

The trouble is, is that I've never seen a "well designed [class based] game
system". Most are just variations on DnD, none truly base the extra abilities
upon the physical/mental attributes, except for an occaisional +/- for an
exceptional one.

True 17th century Britians did not become actors in the Noh theatre, but
several became actors none the less. Such an example does not prove your point,
since actors in Noh are just actors of a very traditional theatre style.

A more appropriate thing to say would have been "Gnomes just don't become 
Illusionists in the same way humans cannot swim like dolphins". Of course if
you are reffering to a cultural difference rather than a racial difference then
just ignore my statement above. Many games assume cultural differences to be
unchanging, rather than dynamic. They do this since no concise way of
describing cultural change exists. You can approximate, but you can't model
reality.

So who's to say that a Gnome raised by humans cannot become an Illusionist? If
the arguements are based on cultural differences then by being raised by humans
he can become one. If he later decides to become a thief, does he lose the
ability to cast illusions or does he find a new way to *use*them*?

The last original FRP game that was ever published was Fringeworthy in 1981(?),
by TRI TAC INC.,(now Tri Tac Systems). It was the first interdimensional
roleplaying game, and in my opinion, the best. The worst is a toss up between
TORG and Lords of Creation, with LoC winning. 

(no flames please, the above is just my opinion.)

How it's done in Bushido:
All character's start with the same number of points to distribute
among attributes.  Then profession modifiers are added.  Each
profession ends up with almost the same amount of modifiers, they just
affect different attributes in different ways. It is assumed that the
character has spent his youth preparing for his profession, and
therefore has certain advantages and disadvantages as a result of that
training. But since you can distribute points any way you want, you
have a custom built character.

Each profession also has a set of bonus skills. Bonus skills get a
plus to use.   This plus exists even if you have no score in a skill.
It is assumed that certain skills are germane to a profession, and
even if you don't actively study them, you'll have some modest
knowledge of them.  It's easier to learn and use bonus skills, but
characters can have any skills at all.  Thus a player tailors his
skills to be whatever he wants.  There are quite a few bonus skills
for each profession, plus their are bonus skills based on background.
a samurai will have bonuses in certain traditional skills the samurai
were expected to know, the peasants have bonuses in things peasants
would know.  Skills include fine arts and practical arts as well as
martial arts.  This are needed because each character must interact
with the society as well as defeating monsters.  

Each skill also has some application for the play of the game.
Japanese classics, for example, gives the character a knowledge of
history, mythology, and legend.  I let characters roll on this skill
to see if they've heard stories about a place/person/monster/etc.  The
better they roll, the more accurate info they get.  (But never all
info, basically just clues.)  Any character can have this skill, but a
character for whom it is a bonus skill is going to do a little better
on average than someone for whom it is not.  And even if it is not a
bonus skill, it is still useful to have.  Unlike other games where it
is very difficult to obtain and ineffective to use something outside
your class.

The bonus is based on level. There are only six levels for humans.
Gods go up to twenty.  Humans add their bonus to all saving throws,
and all bonus skills.  This helps.  The logic is that the longer you
live, the smarter you and more competent you get.  This is reflected
in your increases.  However, while bonuses help, they cannot
adequately replace skill.  

Characters start with certain initial skills based on their
profession. Some skills are dictated, some are electives.  The
dictated skills are part of the idea of what each class is about.  As
a GM, I grant some character's bonus skills that are not part of the
book.  I feel that good character development ought to be aided by the
GM and not frustrated.  So with me, a character can be completely
custom made.  The rules also provide some guidelines for adding skills
that are not in the books, and provides detailed instructions for
designing 'secret teachings'.

Secret teachings are basically ways to allow a character to violate
the rules and get some advantage.  They are skills.  They are subsets
of the basic martial arts skills.  For example, one may elect to learn
the secret teaching "precision strike" for sword.  It applies only to
swords, and allows the   swordsman to do greater damage with any sword
he uses.  There are several others, and rules for making up your own.
The GM must exercise discretion about what he allows Pcs to invent,
otherwise the secret teachings can be too powerful.  These secret
teachings further customize the character.  

So because of the classes, Bushido characters have certain basics in
common, but not always.  The basics of the class are good sound
tactics for gaming, and reasonable interpretations of the genre.  But
nothing makes you play a 'classic warrior', you can have a very
different character from the mainstream.  It is lack of imagination
that limits the characters more than the rules.

Multiclassing in Bushido is not very convenient.  In point of fact,
you can only be a member of one profession at a time, however, since
you can learn any skill, you can be a magic using swordsman if you
want.  It isn't very efficient however.  Which is reasonable, because
magic using warriors are not found in the genre.  Other combinations
are forbidden, at least by this GM: magic using ninja in particular.
Magic in the hands of someone with no scruples is very powerful and
unbalancing to the game.  On the other hand, all classes can use magic
items.  Magic items very, some require skill to use, some work
automatically.  The ones that require skill are of course used most
effectively by those who are built for magic, ie, magic users and
monks.  Although a non standard or well developed warrior could do
just as well.  Deciding how your character feels about magic is one of
the things to consider while making your character.  It can't be good
at everything, you have to make choices.  The more developed your
character gets, the more choices you get to make, and the more kinds
of activities your character can survive/participate in effectively.
But nobody can ever prepare themselves for every eventuality.  So
players prioroities make the characters different as well.  One
swordsman may decide that if he's fast enough, no one will ever hit
him, another may choose to become a tank, figuring if nothing can hurt
him, it doesn't matter if he's slow.  

I think Bushido does an excellent job of combining the virtues of each
system class or skill based, while still allowing plenty of
individuality in the characters, yet providing guidelines for GMs to
rapidly make up NPCs when needed.

I haven't played D&D for a long time, but one could rewrite it to
implement a combination of class and skill, but it wouldn't be D&D any
more.  And personally, I think Bushido does a lot better job of gaming
weapons, skills, combat, etc.  

(Bushido back attacks get +10 to hit.
All character classes get the bonus if they can get behind the target.
However, ninja and budoka are faster and more manuverable than the
typical warrior, so warriors don't manage this tactic as well or as
often as the more nimble classes.  But you could design a fast and
agile warrior if you wanted to, and then it could get behind people
too.  Of course, it would have to sacrifice something else, either
health/hit points, or the mental attributes. Ninja have fewer hit
points, sneaking up behind people is a necessary survival tactic.
Warriors have lots of hit points, they don't need to sneak up behind
people, they can slug it out toe to toe and survive.  All you D&D
players who think thieves have it bad would probably like the way
they play in Bushido. Of course, if you fail to take out a big beefy
warrior on your first hit, and he turns to face you, you're dead
meat....)

Ninja make rather bad magicians.  Because they have no On, they are always 0
level mages at best.  Also, anyone who starts out as a magician is going to
have a really tough time getting himself into a ninja clan, let alone learning
the basic skills for it.  Finally, the more powerful the magician, the more
likely he will have gone up in social rank, which makes it less likely that he
can afford to do so.

The advantages of each class:
Warriors:  Most respected and nasty with swords and bows.  Watch out for
warriors who have a Wood magician friend.  In our game, we had warriors firing
9d6 arrows off who were masters of bows.(For reference characters usually have
somewhere around 15-30 Hitpoints + level*4.  Katanas usually do around 1d6 + 5
or so...)

Budoka:  If they master Atemiwaza, watch out.  Can do the best overall HTH
damage after a while.

Ninja:  Almost impossible to see.  You actually have to suspect there is a 
ninja in the nearby area to look for him...  As good in combat as Budoka, but
not as many hit points.

Shugenja:  Magicians who take up 2 or 3 disciplines can be very flexible.
Usually Metal or Fire and Soil or Wood are the 2 best.  The first 2 give very
powerful offense and the 2nd 2 give lots of support spells to the group.
Water isn't really that useful overall due to On problems.

Priests:  Tend to go up levels FAST.

Yakuza:  Start out with the best overall stats, however other than the fact
that Yakuza aren't universally despised like the ninja are, are basically
inferior ninja.  Because ninja never tell anyone that they are ninja...

Fun game, definitely one of the best systems overall.

I think that 'JOATS' and 'Renaissance men' are not quite as common or as 
neat as you would seem to indicate.  I most certainly would not put Asimov in
this class.  Skill at writing across a number of geners does not qualify him as
a renaissance man.  Can Asimov cook well?  Can he sculpt?  Can he fish for
marlins?  Is he a good soldier?  Can he ride horses?  How is he at sewing and
needlepoint?  Can he deep sea dive?  Can he play football/soccer/basketball?
How about darts or billiards?  Is he a good carpenter?  Can he weld and fix
his own car?

Asimov is not a Renaissance man, he is merely very good at his particular craft,
good enough for him to be flexible enough to stretch the boundaries of it.

True, there is a small minority of people which are alarmingly good at a wide 
variety of things, but true Renaissance men (Da Vinci, Bacon, reputedly) are not
by any means extraordinary at everything they put their minds to.  Except for
a few works, Da Vinci displays none of the artistic prowess of others of his
period.  He was a scientist at the forefront of covert research, who possessed
some undeniable skill as an excellent draftsman, but it is doubtful whether he
had the artistic sensibilities of a Michaelangelo or a Bernini. They, in turn,
lacked his undeniable scientific bent.

Hemingway was an influential writer and an excellent sportsman, but he was sadlyremiss in social graces, and while he may have been proud of the fact that he
could 'sew & cook', his standards in these crafts were no doubt much lower than 
those of most people's mothers.

Renaissance get a reputation because they publicly dabble in a wide variety of
things (often things risque or en vogue) and have enough aplomb and rudimentary
skill to avoid being embarrased publicly.  They are also often the fortunate
few to have a wide and generous education, placing them well above the social
norms of their time.  The reason that there are fewer 'Renaissance men' alive
today, is a tribute to the comparitive excellence of our education system.
Remember the principle of Advanced Science and magic - in the past the 
intellectual powers of these lucky men was likely enough to inspire awe in 
those less fortunate.

There is also the simple fact that today it takes a longer time to amass
sufficient knowledge to be at the forefront of many fields.  The specialized
knowledge of many fields simply did not exist back then.  However, it's
still quite possible to get knowledge in many fields sufficient to con a
lot of people into thinking you may be a Renaissance man, just as some
people attempt to con others into thinking they are good natured.

I've actually read about some company that puts out booklets designed to
let you do just that.  They are sort of "Cliff Notes" for various topics
designed to let you talk at cocktail parties and sound like you know what
is going on.

Sound pretty hurting to me, though, except maybe as part of some elaborate
practical joke.  I think I'd rather be boring than get a personality from
"Cliff Notes" :-) !!!

A player doing that when I was running would -- well, wouldn't be playing!
Roleplaying is the idea, not calculating probabilities and fighting over
trivial minutiae of the rules.  I have seen people do this with many game
systems, including Runequest, AD&D, Powers & Perils and others.  And I
still don't like it, sorry.

Is it really a big issue?  People get very worked up about it, but I have
come more and more to accept that the rules are really rather trivial little
things that don't matter very much.  I use them when they help me to run the
game, and generally ignore them otherwise.

Rolemaster is not as far towards the class end of the
class-based<->non-class-based spectrum as,  say,  D&D,  but it has
substantial elements of "class-based-ness."


>It's also very easy to create new professions, of course, and to alter

Easy?  Rolemaster must be just about the hardest system to create a new
character type for with any sense of whether it's balanced or not.
In a system like GURPS or Hero,  a *player* can create a new type of
character.  Very rarely does one need to haggle with the GM.  (Ok,  I
only know what I've heard -- perhaps it's more frequent than I'm implying.)

>A player doing that when I was running would -- well, wouldn't be playing!
The probability playing can be done when you aren't running,  since it
concerns the expenditure of development points.  For us math geeks,  it's
kind of fun -- sort of a game within a game.  And it really doesn't change
the balance of power that much.


>Roleplaying is the idea, not calculating probabilities and fighting over

RuneQuest can be made close to "minutae proof" without much effort,  and in
fact our house rules generally do that.  I think it would be much harder to
do that with (A)D&D[V2],  especially if you're adding new classes.


>And I still don't like it, sorry.
Nor do I.  But I assert that this is generally easier to do in a class-based
system -- think of the things TSR goes through in the name of game balance.
Eliminate the classes,  and you eliminate a major source for rules-playing.
(Ex:  Ever seen a Rolemaster hobbit burglar with adrenal defense and
martial arts sweeps and throws?  A first level three foot tall combat
machine -- not exactly balanced.)

Rules shouldn't affect character's behaviour,  but all too often they do.
The afore-mentioned rules-playing is an example of the rules having a
detrimental effect on the system.  With an ideal game system,  rules
playing wouldn't be an issue.

Wednesday, 26 September 1990 19:20:26 UTC+1 - Viktor Haag:
Right now there is a lot of talk about game balance - here are a few
observations of my own about this term.
        1)  Game balance is one of the trickiest things to design into a 
game system, let alone preserve when you start tweaking the rules.  However
any game design worth its salt must have some sort of internal 'yard stick'
that was used to equate different parts of the system during the creation
process.
            Quite often this 'yardstick' is preserved and presented whole sale
to the players of the game in question.  For example the Character Point in 
the Hero system is the unti of measure for all Hero games, and the players are
encouraged to use CP's as the measurement of all their creative efforts.  In
other game systems, such as GURPS the 'workings' of the Character Point 
equivalent is partially hidden from the 'user'.
            However, some games acheive a qualitative 'balance' rather than a 
quantitative one.  Rather than designing the entire system around a unit of 
measure such as the Character Point (or equivalent),  game balance is 
acheived by endless playtesting and tweaking.

        2)  Given this, it only makes sense to assume that the games that are
quantitatevly balanced are going to be easier to tweak without endless 
trial and error, than the qualitatively balanced ones.  After all, if you have
to try all the rules tweaks to see if they work, then changing rules will
take along time if you don't want to alter balance.

        3)  Likely the best way to tweak any game system, then, is to try and
impose some sort of quantitative 'yardstick' onto it.  Try and devise a point
system that can assess the values of characteristics, skills, abilities and
so on.  That way adding and tweaking becomes much easier.

        4)  The quick and dirty way to accomplish this is to use the old
'copy and alter' method.  If you want to add a new profession to a class based
system, use one of the existing ones as a template, and then change details one
step at a time.

any thoughts?

        I don't follow this reasoning at all.  It seems to me that the
possibilities for rule-playing would be a function of how many possible
ways there are to develop a specific character (build them all and use
the one that was cheapest to build).  Most systems have relatively few
ways of doing this.  WFRP has quite a few, and Rolemaster has scads of
them, but AD&D allows very little choice along these lines; less than
GURPS, in which you can play around with stat-levels, skill-levels, and
defaults to arrive at the same place through different paths (in fact,
in building their example character in the basic set, they encouraged
this).  Perhaps the high point on a rules-playing curve would be at the
class-skill hybrids, but I don't think it would be true class systems
end of things.

        In an ideal system, yes.  However, I long ago came to the
conclusion that this would be the lowest priority element of an ideal
system.  I think it is the easiest element for dms to consistantly
control.  Of course, I view an ideal system as being designed for me
and those I would be likely to game with, not for the world at large.
Truth be known, I don't care to be associated with most of the gaming

Saturday, 29 September 1990 01:06:15 UTC+1 - S. Gwen Johnson:
I am writing a supplement to Bushido that adds (among other things)
new classes and new skills to the game.  Coherency and game balance
are two very  important considerations.  I do not agree that
quantitifying all aspects of the game is an easy way to try and
development a yardstick to measure the new classes by.  On the
contrary, all games include an internal coherence (some more
consciously and better implemented than others).  Bushido has a very
consistant internal structure, making it easy to expand.  Bushido also
has a very clear concept of the genre it is trying to reproduce.  
In writing the supplement I am writing about the things I wished for
when I was playing the game.  Having read a lot of Japanese history,
legends, folktales, seen movies, etc, I had a good idea of the
sensibilities of heroic Japan.  Several major classes were missing.
The warrior-monk, the warrior-sailor, and the entertainer.  There are
some other classes as well, but I have not yet figured out how to
implement them into the game yet, and am not currently planning to put
them in the supplement.  I asked myself, How are these classes like
the other classes?  How are they different?  Why would somebody want
to play one?  What new rules or skills are needed to implement these
classes?  How will they effect game balance?

Each character class has its strenghts and its weaknesses.  These have
to be carefully designed so that it usefulness is basically equal to
its weaknesses. And theses strengths and weaknesses have to be
balanced against the strenghts and weaknesses of the already existing
classes.  So, does the new class allow a character to do things the
other classes cannot, or at least, do them better?  What things does
it do worse?  Are these things useful?  I can't imagine hairdressing
being a useful skill, would a 'servant' class be useful?  Servants and
sidekicks of various sorts all integral parts of many tales.  Do we
need rules to implement them?  Or can they be done with already
existing rules?  In Bushido at least, they can.  This is because
Bushido recognizes social class as well as profession.  And is it
desirable to add a 'servant' class to Bushido?  That is to say, would
it allow players to do things that can't be done with the existing
rules?  Nope.  So no servant class is needed.  It could be done, maybe
tomorrow I'll have a brilliant brainstorm about how it could be done
and be fun and playable.  But as long as no brilliant brainstorm is
forthcoming, neither is a servant class. Some people will publish
anything they can think of, and some people will buy anything
associated with their game, but that's not how I play, and it's not how I
write.  

To make the new classes balance with the old, one looks at the nubmer
and kind of skills the old classes have, and picks an approximately
equal number of skills, of approximatley equal usefulness, keeping in
mind what it is the character is supposed to be able to do.  And
invent any new skills necessary.  Keep the new skills to the same
degree of abstraction as the old skills.  Make sure that the skills
are reasonable narrow, but not so narrow as to be rarely useful. But
not so broad that they can be used any time anywhere by anybody.  This
requies you to have a gut level understanding of the game and how it
all hangs together.  One can then assign numeric values to them, but
it isn't necessary.  If you understand how useful each skill is, then
you can compare them directly without any need to spend time
quantitifying them.  

And rules tweaking is a good thing.  I have tweaked an awful lot of
Bushido rules over the years, and have found out experimentally why
the rules are good.  On the other hand, I have also found some rules
that were better tweaked.  But not many, and not major.  It is a
credit to Bushido's designers that it hangs together so well in spite
of a lot of very clever people spending a  lot of time trying to
exploit the system.  (I hope my work hangs together so well!)

If a person plays a game a lot, he internalizes its structure and
values.  He can then use that understanding to implement aspect of the
genre he wants, or to use the rules system to create a completely
different but compatible game system.  For example, I am toying
with the notion of making European version of the game.  (Does the
world really need another fantasy role playing game?  Probably not.)

It seems simple enough to me to do this, but then, no one has done it
before, so maybe not.  

Anyhow, game design is a fascinating subject, and is the only kind of
work I have found so far that I enjoy all aspects of.
