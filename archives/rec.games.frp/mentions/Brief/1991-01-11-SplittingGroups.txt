I think the stupid flamewars over cross over game material will start if 
we split on anything other than 

 stories
 resource material
 general (as is now)

Forget splitting on fantasy/sf/spy/misc lines, its a waste of time, kill 
files do just nicely, whereas the stories & resources split will work to 
the benefit of everyone, and there won't BE any cross posting (which is
the main reason a split on the fantasy/sf/spy/misc lines won't work
because of the enormous cross over genre's appearing nowadays), also NO
splitting into GAMES, that is a STUPID idea, there are TO MANY! Oh, and
I vote against moderation as well, some of us have to pay for mail (thru
the nose I might add, receiving and sending), and it dosen't really
encourage us to send submissions does it?

Thats IMHO of course, i've been reading the group for a year or so now,
and the threeway split mentioned above would greatly enhance my (and my 
users, I run a RPG BBS where many people read this newsgroup) use of the 
system, I every now and again miss important bits of resources and
stories because they get lost in the noise in this area. I missed out on 
Other Suns (the BIG posting of it) because of this.
