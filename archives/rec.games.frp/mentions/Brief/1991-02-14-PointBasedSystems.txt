TITLE: Point Based Systems

To Mary Kuhner:
 
Glad to be of help.  Your concerns are quite legitimate; it's been 
a dichotomy for a long time how much of a character's internal world 
should be under the control of game mechanics.  Some people are simply 
so dedicated to GURPS or Hero that they cannot help but respond to 
qualms on someone's part as an attack.

To Jeff Stehman:
 
Jeff, face it, the problem is that you are arguing the wrong point. 
 The point that you are arguing is that game rules are a bad idea. 
 While I don't agree (I consider such positions an excessively role 

playing/storytelling gamers position), until you start addressing 
that one instead of arguing point based systems, you and a lot of 
people are going to keep shouting past each other.
Me, I don't WANT to have to keep improvising all the kinds of things 
handled by skill rules and other mechanics.  I'd rather save my energies 
for better things.

        Work it out with your GM.  The rules don't say you can't do it; they
just SUGGEST a -40 point limit.  Yes, the Book does use the word "suggested".
It also says, "But each GM should set their own limits and guidelines, as 
appropriate for each campaign.  Keep it fun."
        Sounds fair to me.

|to take up more game time than anybody else's concerns.

        Actually, it says:

        "Game Masters should be careful [about] how many disadvantages
        they allow their players to take.  This problem is often self-
        correcting; someone who plays a one-eyed, berserk, deaf hunch-
        back who is afraid of the dark will either a) kill the poor 
        fellow off to be rid of him or b) have so much fun that nobody
        else will really mind.  But too many disadvantages can turn your
        game into a circus."

        [pg. 26, 3rd ed.]

        Which is basically correct; if EVERYONE is running around with a ton
of disads, and the GM is actually enforcing them, you spend more time adjucating
everyone's psychoses than you spend running the adventure.

|
|my retort would be the gm who can't control his own campaign is up a
|creek, and no game system will float him out, so stop trying to force
|game balance in the rules!

        This is the Wrong Way of Doing It.  It is the responsibility of the 
rules (and the designers) to ensure that the game has some degree of balance 
to it.  If it doesn't, it will turn into a nightmare in the hands of anything
less than an expert GM.  Which are few and far between.


|
|don't legislate morality in my country, and don't force game balance in
|my game!

        If you don't like the way the game is balanced, change it.  It's much
easier to REMOVE balances than it is to ADD them.

        Then he should have read his own rules- the first page of the rule

        It specifically does NOT give the GM the power to control PC's through
whimseys.

        You sure that a) this was a co-author of the Whimsey Cards, and not of
the game, and b) this wasn't a playtest version?

        I've got the cards, and I've been thinking about using them in my Supers
game.  I wouldn't recommend them to GM's who don't know their players VERY well,
but I've been gaming with this bunch for a while and I trust them to not go off
into the ozone layer if I give them whimseys.

Friday, 15 February 1991 16:38:40 UTC - GALACTIC COMMANDER:
I hope this will answer your question about character point balance.  First
of all let me state that I have GMd 2 separtae campaigns of HERO Supers,
1 of HERO Fantasy, a AD&D/RM/RQ bastardization comglomeration of our
own.  I have also run in 3 HERO Supers, 1 GURPS Supers, 1 GURPS fantasy,
and that same bastardization system under a different GM, also a
post-holocaust AFTERMATH.  I think this qualifies my answer as mearly
opinion and not binding, even on myself!!
Whenever a character picks up something during a campaign you have to
look at what it is.  Mostly I tell the characters that they are 0 point
advantages or disadvantages that just happen because the character did
something. 

An example of this is Super-SPY James Pond defeats a common
thug that assaults him in his apartment.  James decides he likes the
THUG's 9mm pistol instead of his Water PPK (what else would a frog
have), so he decides to keep it.  It is pretty common so he can pick up
ammo for it and cleaning kits....congratulations a 0-point advantage.

Along the same line James manages to piss of the Mayor of Chicago
(something about staring a fire fight on the El), he is now being
watched by the Mayor of Chicago who want to punish him.....same thing a
0-point disadvantage. 

The third type is when James beats up on Blowfish (and his super-scientist)
and gets the Sub-sonic emp-gun (a silent assassin's weapon), James must pay
the points if he wishes to keep the weapon.  This is to reflect the attempt
to become knowledgeable with its operation, cleaning, ammo, ect....James can
use the weapon with modifiers against hitting until he pays for it, since he
hasn't learned enough about its quirks yet.  Anyone who knows anything about
guns will tell you that each gun has its own characteristics.  Common guns
are just easier to understand.  This is indirect spending of experience
since the character pays the points for something the GM designed for
someone else to use.

The forth type is direct spending of experience.  James talks to Z
(noted scientist working for 7) and asks him to make him a flamethrower
built into a jockstrap (don't ask why!!!).  The character then pays the
points and gets the item.

I hope this clarifies some of your questions.  Any other answers would
be better off being e-mailed to me.  I read mail more that anything
else.  The points are only used to keep respective powers on the level
with other powers when starting characters.  Otherwise you would have
Glacatus (defender of the universe) and Wimpy man (defender of the
backyard) run by different characters.  An interesting situation, but
not to the liking of the character running Wimpy man (who get to do
nothing, but bumble into trouble.  After this points are only a
guildline for the third example and helpful for the forth example!!!

Not true.  Both classes of role-players are considered to be geeks by

        No, the problem is that there are at least two definitions of
flexibility floating around, which is why I started this; I wanted to
point out that there was more than one way to look at flexibility.
As I've said several times before, I'm fully aware that most people

I will grant that some of the responses to Mary's qualms were overreactive.  
On the other hand, I posted a note to a fellow GURPS player and get an
unwarranted, intrusive flame from Wayne Shaw to the effect that GURPS is 
bogged down with the game designer's prejudices and lacks the courage of 
its own convictions.

Small wonder people sometimes get defensive, when Mr. Shaw drops flames 
in one post then self-righteously decries defensive responses in the next.

Mary - this is my first response to your questions about your character.
There are a number of ways to handle it, from full addiction to mild
addiction to quirk to not mentioned on the character sheet.  If you were
playing in a GURPS game that I GMed, you would discuss how you saw the
character with me, and I would *suggest* (not demand) a route to take,
and explain the gaming significance to you.  If this was not
satisfactory, I would suggest another, until you were pleased.  I
suspect, from what I've read of your posts, that Jay would have a quirk
in a game that I GMed.  That would mean you could play it as much as you
wanted to, but didn't have to roll to avoid it when it was important that
you abstained.  Kicking the habit could be roleplayed as much or as
little as you liked in such a case.

Take Champions.

Proceed to double the number of points necessary needed to do things.
Make the emphasis "grim and gritty".  In case anyone wasn't aware "grim/gritty
" does not equal realistic.
Remove the meta-rules.
Make a bunch of arbitrary decisions on spells without telling GMs why you
made them.
Assume Linear Abilities.  Were you aware that world champion weightlifters
can have either 50 or 100 Strengths if you don't use GURPS Supers?  That
world champion runners have to have at least 20 health and 20 dexterity in
order to move that fast?  Yet there are no skill based characters that are
similar in effect?
Magery 3 by itself is absolutely worthless, yet buying it can cripple some
character conceptions(such as the 'best potential mage in the world, but knows
nothing at the moment, needs to find a master to teach him...a classic all
throughout Fantasy literature, but no one can afford such a thing)
Giving a stat a name like IQ.  IQ has no meaning unless you happen to be a
white, middle-class male.

I'll be nice and leave GURPS Supers out of this.
        
BTW, in case you hadn't guessed, it is quite possible, and in fact ridiculously
easy, to build GURPS in Champions.  It is easier than creating a worldbook
for GURPS given GURPS.  Try the reverse sometime.  Look what happened with
GURPS Supers.  Oops.

Please mention some.  I have yet to be convinced that a character
conception exists that:

1.  Is appropriate to the campaign proposed.  James Bond (or his
opponents) is not appropriate in a GURPS or Hero spy campaign
using normal power levels, for example.

2.  Is not abusive.  One popular abuse is the character that is just
like the other characters but has an extra advantage.

3.  Cannot be created in GURPS or Hero, in some reasonable form.

I think we have a confusion between "for nothing" and "without expending
experience points".  If a character does something, the character should
be rewarded or penalized in the logical manner without regard to experience
points.  If a character increases his wealth by killing a dragon and
looting the hoard, then the character is wealthier, and forcing the
character to pay experience points for this makes no sense.

The corollary is that killing and looting dragons should not be made
easy, or everybody will do it.

To quote a respected local GM:  "Don't worry if your character doesn't
balance.  I'll just take it out in blood."

A distinction must be drawn between Hero system heroic and super-heroic
campaigns.  In superhero campaigns, characters must pay points for
their possessions, partly for game balance and partly because comic-
book superheros don't generally pick up gadgets from defeated foes.
(The Champions rules suggest that a superhero be allowed to use a gadget
free in the adventure he/she picks it up, but must pay points for it
to keep it.)  In heroic campaigns, the characters do not pay points for
equipment - and, yes, this does mean that a Fantasy Hero character with
magic items can easily be higher in point value than a Champions
character with more points.

In a heroic campaign, this is not a character advantage.  In Champions,
it is a ranged killing attack, obvious independent focus, uses
charges and clips....

Nobody yet has seriously suggested that a character get experience for
disadvantages acquired during play.

In Hero, characters buy weapons familiarities, and can use all weapons
covered by these familiarities.  The character should not be asked to
spend additional points to use a covered weapon, and should not be asked
to spend more points than a special weapons familiarity in any case.
The GM should decide whether he or she wants James to be able to keep
the emp-gun; if not, U division grabs it to analyze, and breaks it.

In Justice, Inc., there were gadget rules which basically covered this.
This allowed characters who were inventors, or had help from inventors,
to make devices according to the power rules.  This works OK, and I
would ask somebody wanting a flamethrowing jock strap to follow these
rules.

This conflicts with what you said earlier.  Points are best used when
designing characters and changing the character.  Charging for
equipment acquisition and other changes to the world around seems
unnecessary.  Just don't give out ridiculous amounts of stuff.

This is irrelevant, since points mean nothing.  Would a game that used

How about a game that uses no points?  By your logic, it is infinitely
better!

What does it equal?  In case you're not aware, it doesn't mean anything

You mean the easily abusable rules?  True, they allow great flexibility,
but they demand the GM be constantly on his guard - it gets wearisome.
I'd rule this one personal taste - you win a little, you lose a little.

This is blatant falsehood.  I have characters with Magery 3 and no

Too bad, it's really your only strong card in this whole post.  GURPS
Supers is admittedly weak.  Supers II is in the works, and Loyd has shown

changes.

I doubt it - I've created a worldbook for GURPS given GURPS, and I'd
rather do that than legislate a Champions game.

The point basis for GURPS with a few minor changes(those listed below) is
Champions redone.  ST = +2 Strength, DX = +1 Dex with no speed, HLTH = +1
body, IQ = +2 Int.

No, meta-rules are the how and why all powers work.  Not "because the game
designer decided that he thought a given pole arm does 2d6 with X ST"
The GM also doesn't have to be constantly on his guard either.  Just when
the characters get submitted, and it is about as easy in Champions as it is
in GURPS to recognize such events.


>>Make a bunch of arbitrary decisions on spells without telling GMs why you

>Such as?
Why do spells interrelate?  Why do spells have certain given ranges and why
can't a particular spell caster have *just* a longer range than another?  Why
do magic spells drain fatigue?  Why can't you improve on one area of a spell,
such as time of casting, instead of having to improve the entire spell?  How
does one simulate AD&D magic using GURPS, because spells don't fatigue, power
increases as one gets better, yet time and items needed don't.  Does one need
to guess completely or do the rules help you out.



>This is blatant falsehood.  I have characters with Magery 3 and no

Yeah, right.  This is called 35 points for a character concept.  Either the
players doing this have a significant edge in experience and can thus afford
to do this or your game doesn't actually challenge characters, just the
players.  Because you have a maximum of 145 points in a given character and
are spending 1/4 of your points for no effect, something is wrong if such
a character is competitive with other characters not buying magery 3.

It is ridiculous to have to pay a significant percentage of ones points for
merely the ability to have an interesting character concept.

        You know, the posts on this board are really starting to crack me up...
Flexibility meaning not having rules covering things?? That's like
saying flexibility in government means not having laws covering things.
It's silly.

If flexibility means not having rules, why not just drop AD&D and play
'pretend'? Since there are no rules, it's INFINITELY flexible!! (YAY!)

This makes even less sense. They don't have the rules that you don't
want. So the rules they don't have, the areas of flexibility, are the
places you don't want. So you don't want flexibility??? They have the
rules you DO want... you just don't like the rules. I thought you liked
AD&D??????

You are beginning.. well, continuing... to make very little sense.

This is pointless.  I like Hero - why should I try to bash it?  It's a
good system, but GURPS is *more to my taste.*  I claim no superiority for
it.  I saw you backed off some points like a gentleman, so I can be one
and back off the rest.

Actually, SJG and Hero are on very friendly terms, and their histories
are intertwined.  Original Champions was influenced by TFT, SJ's first
game.  GURPS was influenced by Original Champions.  Later editions of
Champions were influence by GURPS.

I still don't agree with you about the spell system - I *like* SJG's
spell system.  All I can say is it makes sense to me, mostly. Out of 420
some spells, I'd say only a dozen or so seem to be in the wrong college
or have flakey prerequisites.  It doesn't appear arbitrary to me at all.

As for the character with Magery 3 and no spells, I am mystified by your
attitude that it's just a concept.  It's a concept that you brought up: a
common archetype in fantasy literature.  And most of those that I've read
of go on to learn spells: hence, the 35 points aren't "just for a
concept," but will eventually be used.

At any rate, I'm dropping the issue.  Enjoy your game, whatever it may
be!

What's wrong with using lots of points for character conception??? What
the hell does 'competitive' mean?
I think part of the problem is that you are thinking in terms of
combat/min-max games and he is thinking role playing.

Both sides of this argument tend to call the other side bad roleplayers
whenever we disagree, not the most productive tactic.

Even a good roleplayer can be concerned with having a character powerful
enough to survive and capable enough to contribute to what the group is
doing.  Many GMs, including myself, are unhappy about having one
character who is significantly weaker than the others, even if the
player doesn't mind.  Such people are hard to keep alive, and hard to
justify in many adventures (why *are* we bringing Auntie May along?)

If the point system is there to balance initial characters, leading to a
party in which everyone can contribute fairly, I don't think it's
unreasonable to criticize it for not doing so, as in the case of the
Magery 3 non-caster.

The difference between GURPS magic and Hero magic is flexibility.
The GURPS magic system is, IMHO, very good, and is not as subject
to abuse as the Hero system.  It isn't nearly as flexible.  I could
design pretty much any GURPS spell in Hero, but the reverse is not
true.
In GURPS, if you want a damage spell, you look through the list and
find one to your liking; the book will tell you how hard it is to
learn (Hard or Very Hard), how much energy it takes, how long to 
cast, etc.  If you don't know the spell well, you must perform
obvious gestures and incantations, and take full time and energy;
as you learn the spell better, it takes less time, energy, and
required actions on a single sliding scale (unless you are using
the optional rule in the sidebar).

In Hero, if you want a damage spell, you select one of four
effects, add modifications to taste, decide on a special effect,
and you have a spell.  You calculate a point value which is probably
fairly reasonable; you have END costs, etc., that are also probably
fairly reasonable.  You can mix and match spellcasting needs.

In a Fantasy Hero campaign, I had a character create a "holdout"
spell, since he kept being captured, stripped, bound, and gagged.
This spell required no materials, gestures, or incantations; it
did require extra time, extra ENDurance, close concentration, and
had dire effects should the spell fail.  He could not have done this
in a GURPS campaign; instead, he would have had to learn a standard
spell *very* well indeed, which might have had bad effects in the
rest of the game (see the "Johnny One-Spell" discussions).

Also, Hero is much simpler to tailor than GURPS.  If you have no
real idea of how magic should work, or if you like the model
GURPS uses, that's fine; I had strong ideas as to how magic should
work in my campaign, and found it easy to manipulate Hero magic
accordingly.

I really don't see substantive differences between the two systems
in other ways.

I wish you great enjoyment of GURPS; I'll continue to use FH.

I could've sworn that the potential mage had been addressed in GURPS Magic,
but I just checked and I can't find it.  I am surprised that such a common
archetype from fiction was not covered, but I suppose that such a fine
supplement is entitled to at least one ommission.  In any event, GURPS
Magic does provide an out for the experienced Game Master (p. 93):

     "GMs can create more limitations for magery, keeping costs in line
     with those given.  ... It is suggested that no limitation, no matter
     how great, reduce the cost of magery below 5 points for the first
     level and 3 for added levels."

So, here is one conception for the limited magery Potential Magery:

Potential Magery Cost:                                 5 points for 1st level
                                        3 points /level for additional levels

Potential magery is bought in addition to any other magery that a character
may have.  Potental magery may not be used to improve spell skill rolls, but
does improve the magical sensitivity of the character (so a character with
Magery 1 and Potential Magery 2 would recognize a magical object on a roll
of IQ + 3 or less).  GM's may choose to let Potential Magery apply as a
prerequisite to spell *learning*, but characters should only be allowed to
*cast* spells for which they have the actual magery prerequisites.  Charac-
ters may apply future experience points to buying Potential Magery up to
full (or an aspected) magery.  For example, Marvin starts with Magery 1 and
Potential Magery 2.  He recognizes magic on a roll of IQ+3 and is recognized
by others as a powerful mage (Magery 3), but may only cast spells with a
prerequisite of Magery 1.  This costs him 15 points for Magery 1, plus 8
points for Potential Magery 2.  Marvin collects his experience points until
he has the difference required for Magery 2 (the difference between addi-
tional levels of Magery and additional levels of Potential Magery), or 7
points.  After paying the points and obeying any further campaign specific
requirements he will be Magery 2 and Potential Magery 1.  An additional 5
points could bring him up to Magery 3 (and no Potential Magery).

>-Steffan O'Sullivan      s...@oz.plymouth.edu <>


I thought I'd include the whole thing.  This seems to be a pretty
common example of the debate.  Here is a summary of what I hear.

D&D--Easy to run, easy to settle rules disputes(in most cases, there
are exceptions), many situations are resolved by the imaginations of
GM and players (for some this is a major plus for others this is a
major minus) since there are no rules to cover the situation.  Clear
well defined limits on character conceptions (again this has its
pluses as it does its minuses).  Combat is very fast and even somebody
with a phobia for simple arithmetic can usually handle the mechanics.

GURPS--Introduces a more complex variety of possibilities.  Rule
disputes are harder to settle but all powers and special abilities are
fully delineated and there is usually a clear answer.  Character
creation is like going into a store, you can only buy the items on the
shelf but there are a huge collection of possibilities.  Most
situations can be resolved using rules.  Combat is not slow and given
reasonable training most players can get the hang of what is going on.
Everything is built assuming a average human norm and some find this
restrictive (but again this can be seen as a bonus).

HERO--Tries to cover all possibilites (can create a shapeshifting
demon with innate wind powers without even stretching the system).
Some rule disputes rage on endlessly (but can be very enjoyable to
those who like them).  Character creation is like designing your own
sports car, you get complete control over every characteristic, 
everything is custom made (for instance you can make up any type
of special effect for your energy blast that you wish).  Combat
can be slow (but nonetheless still enjoyable) and many times even
GMs can be unclear exactly how to resolve certain situations given
the stated rules(let alone the players, there is always one player
who seems to not understand how to apply his defenses against
a physical killing attack).


Now of course this is a simplification, some people object to certain
rules(in D&D its alignments, in GURPS it seems to be certain magic or
super power rules, in Champions it seems to be lack of realism in some
of the rules).  However, all of these complaints are easily fixed and,
at least to me, are far from being a damning condemnation of the
systems.  To me none of these systems is necessarily better than the
other but they do seem to have different levels of complexity which
may appeal to some and not others.  I think there are different types
of people who are attracted to roleplaying.  Some see it as a simple
board game with a little bit of extra color to enhance the fun.
Others see it as a place to let the imagination roam free, with games
being practically like writing a novel.

   To flesh this idea out more fully, if I were simulating roleplayers
I would give them two stats.  Both of these stats are from 1-10 with 1
being very low and 10 being the maximum.  (Maybe some nonhumans can
have higher stats -:) )

TECH--This is the technical level they desire in their game.  A TECH
of 3 or less shows a lack of interest in the tactical aspects of the
current system they are playing. A TECH between 4 and 7 is normal
shows some interest in game mechanics, for instance such a person
might be interested in simulating the difference between a knife cut
and a punch to the head with a club.  A TECH greater than 7 is a
person very interested in game mechanics and loves to discuss various
virtues and problems involved with simulating various fantastic
possibilities.  (What sort of damage would Macho Man do if he were to
wield a heavy refrigerator as a club?)

IMAG--This is the imagination level the character desires in the game.
An IMAG of 3 or less shows little interest the world, the personalities
of the other characters, and tends to describe his characters by
what it can do in a combat situation using only the language of the
gaming system involved.  An IMAG between 4 and 7 likes some imagination,
he/she will be interested in whatever major conflicts are occuring in
the world, will notice the other characters enough to insult them
creatively, and sometimes might even care what clothing the character
wears or what image it projects to others.  An IMAG of over 7 probably
means the player has actually written up background for some of his/her
characters, maybe even going as far to describe ancestors, certain important
defining events, and typical social quirks without being forced to by
the GM.  An IMAG over 7 usually likes roleplaying and sometimes will
be happy to sit around for hours at a time without doing combat.



It is clear that there will be a conflict between the high TECH, low
IMAG types (though you have to have some IMAG to be very high
TECH and vice versa but usually you can detect which of the two
characteristics defines the roleplayer) and low IMAG, high TECH
types.  Some like their games with lots of rules and usually enjoy
the strategic considerations of using the rules to maximum advantage
during combat. Others think that rules can be sometimes be useful,
but its more important that the events of the campaign contribute
towards the mood or storyline of the situation.  Of course this
is a vast oversimplification(I'll leave it to others to figure
out whatever other characteristics and special abilities you
would need to fully simulate a roleplayer), but I think you get the point.

Now, I am definitely determined by my TECH score (After all I'm
trying to simulate roleplayers. -:) ).  I see HERO system lovers as
being high TECH types and D&D players as low TECH types with
GURPS having an unclear position somewhere in between.  Some of
course will disagree (actually I can probably count on it) but that
is how I see some of the current debate, not so much saying "my
roleplaying system is better than yours" but more like "my way
of gaming is better than yours".

                          -Sam

P.S.  I am not saying that low TECH types are incapable of mastering
complex systems, for instance I know of one person who easily mastered
the HERO system but prefers D&D(he likes the more computer game mentality
of it) and of another who prefers the HERO system but probably will
never master anything more complicated than D&D.  The TECH stat
is only an expression of what type of game they prefer, NOT what
sort of game they can play.

              I will be the first to admit, GURPS is a *VERY* cumbersome system
 whether it is GURPS supers or not... *But*, for your statement about ST, and
champ. Weight lifters. The World record for power lifting is what? ~600 pounds?
Well, that would be a 30! strength (400 CPs), not 50 to 100 ST...
 
              Now, on to the main reason of my post, to quibble with your fig.s
about a champ runner. (S)he would *not* need a 20 DX and 20 HT. Instead, (s)he
would probably take a DX of ~15, and a HT of ~17, then buy his/her running    
skill to an absolutely disgusting level. Why?? Because that skill is HT based,
not DX, and because you divide the skill level of the skill by 8 and add it 
DIRECTLY to the char.'s basic speed. eg: DX:16 (80? pts) HT:18 (100pts) and
Running (P/H): 24 (48 pts); resulting in a basic speed of: (16+18)/4=8.5, and
a speed of 8.5+(24/8)=12.5 (round down) for 12. That means, this character now
can run, sustained for quite awhile (assuming a high ST as well) at 24MPH (Spd
*2). :) Mind you, you'll NEVER pull off a 100 pt character like that, the 200-
300 pts is more likely. ;)

              The reason (stated in GURPS) for making a character "loose" CP's 
when something bad happens to a character, is to reflect the lower "point cost"
in "buying" a similar character. Also stated quite emphatically quite near-by,
is that the character, does *NOT* all of a sudden have an extra X character
points to spend on new advantages and skills. The opposite is also true to an
extent. If (for example), an amputee character in a fantasy (or SF) campaign,
has a regeneration spell cast on his/her missing arm (for SF, read cybornetic/
bionic/cloned replacement with no gadgets added), said character does *not* 
suddenly add x points to their total; said character must pay for the "assist-
ance" of suddenly not being an amputee, with first: unspent CP's, then CP's
gained later in the campaign if the cost exceeds the unspent CP's, or they have
none unspent. ie: if you have GURPS _Horseclans_, read the description of the
'undiing' advantage.

    Well, then I see the problem as determining the purpose of the
party. If the party's main activity is combat, then obviously anyone not
good at combat will suffer. If the party's main activity is intrigue,
social skills come foreward/ contacts/ patrons/ enemies, etc., while
combat skills retreat somewhat. If the party needs magic, the mages will
be important. Etc.

I think what's necessary is to judge a character's usefulness FOR THE
GAME YOU INTEND TO PLAY. ie- Point costs don't work, since usefulness
depends ENTIRELY on the activities the PCs will be engaged in.

Personally, I like interesting PCs. Interesting characters make good
reactions. The combat monsters will always find other combat monsters
that are better than them. That's why other characters are important.
(That's ANOTHER problem... people tend to scale the opposition to the
PCs. I like having many options... if the PCs go up against a vastly
superior enemy, they will most likely die. It's up to the PCs to decide
who to attack/deal with.)

Um, one problem that I see with your system.  Both the arguers if I make
my guess correctly, are high 'TECH' and 'IMAG' types.  Being one of them,
I am pretty sure about myself and I would guess the same about Stephen.

I personally am happy to have my characters wander around for years without
combat.  As long as things are interesting, why care about beating something
up.  I'm also an artist(painter).  I certainly hope I have a lot of imagination
or else I won't get very far :-)

        RE the potential mage "problem"
        If you have any Magery at all to begin with, you can buy it up later.
(The Book doesn't explicitly say you can do this, but it does imply it, and
it's been declared Official on SJG-BBS.)  Thus, there is no need to blow 35
points on Magery "potential"; you can spend 15 and buy the rest later.  Some
people (myself among them, when I used the standard GURPS magic rules) used
a "Magery 0" costing 5 points, even further lowering the cost.

Flexibility can mean different things.  First of all, I have not played
FH since 1987, so please don't interpret anything I say here as a flame -
I'm honestly curious.

How many points does it cost for an average spell in FH?  It is in my
memory that an FH mage could indeed create his own spells, very fine 
tuned (fits one definition of flexibility), but that he couldn't have
very many different spells, as they cost more than one point each,
usually.  On the other hand, I have 100-point GURPS mages with 50 spells
covering 10 different types of magic (colleges), which fits another
definition of flexibility.  Again, not a flame, but an honest question:
could a starting mage in Hero have 50 spells at a decent level?

What were the effects of the spell?  If it is merely to get rid of his
bonds, that's easy and cheap in GURPS - you don't even have to be a mage.
A Knack of Shatter with one level of Speed will do it quite nicely: 20
points total, no need for high IQ or Magery, even.

Also, have you seen the article in Roleplayer (the GURPS magazine), I
think #19, that I wrote on Improvisation Magic as the Only Magic?  It
expands the Improv rules given in GURPS Magic and makes it easier to cast
spells for improvising mages - including with no gestures, BTW.  I
believe that this system can handle anything that Hero handles.  It will
probably be reprinted in the forthcoming GURPS Grimoire.

I'd have to say that our playing styles are very diferent, Mary.  There
is always room in my games for non-combat characters.  You may be
bringing Auntie May along because of her knowledge, her social skills,
her earthy wisdom, her magical abilities, etc.  There are plenty of
examples in Fantasy fiction of the Auntie Mays being useful even though
they're a liability in a fight.

Point system do not automatically create "balanced" characters.  I'm not
even sure there is such a thing.  A ten-point fighter can take out a
100-point halfling thief, but that does not mean the halfling is not a
valuable character.

The Magery 3 non-caster can be very useful in other ways (he can
recognize magic items, for example, and tell mana levels), and 35 points
is no big deal.  I have run a 75-point character in a game where everyone
else had 100-point characters, and (A) had a good time, (B) didn't
prevent anyone else from having a good time, and (C) was useful to the
party and the mission at hand.

As to the cost of Magery 3: I had assumed Andy meant it to be used
eventually, since he quoted his source as popular fiction.  If he doesn't
ever intend the character to use Magery 3 in the game, just have it,
there are a number of possible ways to handle it.  Latent magery can be
very cheap - I've already allowed this in a game, and the forthcoming
GURPS Grimoire will probably have rules for it for those who can't
extrapolate easily.

Precisely.  In the werewolf case, you'd really only be liable for the
points if you wanted to *stay* a werewolf, which is overall an
advantage (at least for a "generic" GURPS werewolf).

As should be quite clear from all the net discussion on the subject,
this is a thorny issue, and it's not at all clear that GURPS has it
right.  However, GURPS tends to err on the side of protecting game
balance, assuming GMs are smart enough to know when to relax the rules
when it makes sense to do so.

Actually, with a good GM, the issue shouldn't come up in the first
place -- in GURPS there's no real way for characters to gain
advantages unless the GM somehow gives them out.  There are a very few
advantages which the character can actively seek to gain, and it makes
sense to charge points for these, in my opinion.  But "unwanted"
advantages are really GM mistakes, I think.

Character point totals don't really mean much in my campaigns, after
character creation.  On the other, some form of point balance to
control advancement makes a certain amount of sense.  Adding
advantages is a form of advancement, usually.

As for economic advantages/disadvantages, I'd say they really are
worth point-balancing.  In my games someone with little money is often
at a significant disadvantage in the campaign vs. someone with a lot
of money, so it is a game balance issue.

On the other hand, it's very hard to make a case for characters with
different economic levels getting paid wildly different amounts for a
job they performed in common.  As far as I'm concerned, *that's* the
big problem with acquired advantages -- it's much more common to
acquire a lot of money than it is to be bitten by a werewolf, or
gifted by the Great God of Oooka-Looka with Night Vision.  So far, I
haven't seen a really good answer to this problem, other than that the
GM needs to control money in the campaign very carefully.

Hmm...  Your objection to my original article seems valid (how
annoying).  However I would say that a person who prefers the HERO
system probably (but clearly not necessarily) has a higher TECH stat
because unlike GURPS you can usually specify how want certain powers
to work (for instance your fire blast may mostly unaffected by water
(lose a couple of dice maybe at GM's perogativ while anothers can't
even get started (need to light a match)).  The point is you can
decide how every single attack and every single power works in
relation to the rest of the world.  If you think a power shouldn't do
stun damage you can change it by putting a limitation on it.  Of
course the down side to this is that the system allows more
flexibility and it is hard for a gamemaster to impose a certain
consistent methodology to how the world works (for instance a
gamemaster who was running a space game might feel obliged to specify
all the special effects that are allowable with certain powers, but
this would be a lot of work, GURPS to some extent does this for you.)
Though on the flip side you are much more at the mercy of the GM,
because he gets to design the rest of the world in the same manner
that you built your character.  Well anyway, I think I'll think
about this some more and maybe I can come up with a better system
for simulating roleplayers.

Although I agree with this, the book does not say it, and having it
declared "official" on some BBS is totally irrelevant, because not
everyone has ready access to this source.  D+D had this problem with
"The Sorcerer's Scroll" from Dragon magazine, which was also official
but not everyone had access to.  As the game stands, it is not "legal"
and therefore takes special GM permission.  There is a problem with
potential magery.
Please do not use this kind of privledged and questionably legal knowledge.
It doesn't really help anything.

A major disadvantage to point-build systems vs random roll/skill

I've been running Other Suns for a good 12 years now, and while
some of the characters run in the campaign are fairly powerful,

It's difficult to rate an "average" spell in FH.  My run-of-the-mill
spells tend to run about 5-10 points.  This is for the old FH; I haven't
designed any magical characters for the new edition.  In general, a
1-point spell will not be useful.  Therefore, you are correct in this
claim; if you want your spellcasters to have 25-50 different spells,
don't play Hero.  However, Hero spells are typically more versatile,
there being only 50-60 different Hero spell effects as opposed to
c. 420 GURPS spells (many of which would be built with the same
spell effects in Hero).  A FH mage, in my experience, will have 4-8
spells or 5-15% of the possible effects; a GURPS mage with 50 spells
has about 10-12% of the possible spell list.

If you're using knacks.  The spell in question was a 2-die variable-
effect Transform.  I could use it to transform bonds into throwing
knives, rock into air (not very fast), and to make lots of useful
items of low quality.  It was very useful when captured, and had
some uses in other situations.  It was expensive and difficult to
cast, and it could be changed, with added experience, like any
other spell.
So, a 20-point Knack will do it in GURPS, but that isn't integrated
with the rest of the magic system.  A mage might prefer to have
Shatter at a skill of 21, which will do much the same, as well as
allow the mage to do a two-die Shatter under any circumstances,
without being obvious, and without fatigue cost.  Now that I look
at the rules more (I am not all that familiar with GURPS magic
in detail), there is an alternative casting system in the sidebar
on p. 7 of GURPS Magic that would permit casting under these
conditions at -10 to the roll - acceptable under the circumstances
(you'll probably roll it eventually).

No, I haven't.  It would be interesting to see.  As I said, the main
reason why I had to use FH was to model magic as I wanted; if GURPS
had the same capabilities, that would be an option.

Yes, this is true.  One has to tread lightly with these at character
creation time.  As a GM, I tend to discourage (though not forbid)
characters with disads I think will cause serious problems in the
group.

Though the groups I play in tend to follow the "he's a PC" rule, there
have been occassions where a PC has been ejected due to serious
differences in the party.  Also, if you have several PCs in a campaign
world, the PC groups can shuffle around a bit until they can at least
tolerate each other.

In that case, most of the people I play with would probably kick out
the player.  This is the same sort of person who wants to play CE
thieves or assassins in AD&D.  Not much you can do with them except
stomp on them somehow.

In my games, I disallow certain disads.  In particular, I am strongly
opposed to characters having the Bloodlust disad, since I tend to run
games in fairly civilized areas, and such a character is almost
certain to wind up behind bars, or meeting the executioner.

I think one idea that ought to work well is to set up a session before
a campaign starts where everyone works together on characters.  Mix of
skills in a group is a similar problem to making sure there won't be
severe incompatibilities.  Both take input from all the players and
the GM.

Huh?  Why is paying for a gained advantage a problem?  Only if the GM
forces the advantage on the PC *without the player's consent*.  That's
bad gaming on the GM's part, no matter how you work the mechanics.

If the GM wants to give the character a new advantage, without cost,
he can.  This is appropriate if the character achieved the advantage
by roleplaying and not simly GM oversight.

>If you pay for your advantages, you end up loosing potential points.

But you still get the game-effect value of the advantage.  This is
only a problem if you'd never want to take the advantage for the
character.

No, to either case.  Wealth increases *are* a problem in GURPS -- the

a magic item doesn't count as an advantage in GURPS -- that's a Hero
glitch.

Because you get the game effect of more power.  Think of it as a
different form of character improvement using experience.  The problem
only arises when the GM *forces* the character to take an unwanted
advantage.  This is usually Wealth, in my experience.

What do you call character advancement systems?  They're an attempt at

Why are they a problem?  If you're talking about their effect on the
"Flat broke" or "Poor" disads,  they are extremely poorly designed from
what I've heard.  If you could email me the text of the current ones
(sorry,  I don't own GURPS),  I'll post a redesign which you can also
give to Steve Jackson and Co.

(Essentially,  the problem is that they are treated as independent from
their causes.  If a character is flat broke,  there's some reason for
it -- but these disads don't seem to take this into account.  Note that
I've never read the actual rules,  I've just heard people describe them,
so my analysis may be in error.)


>Owning a magic item doesn't count as an advantage in GURPS -- that's a
>Hero glitch.
Why doesn't it count as an advantage?  In Hero,  it could be easily
justified -- after all,  the high tech weapon is going to break down
unless the character has the skills to maintain it,  or else the item
is dependent on the original character and its radiated spider bite
power or whatever.  The problem with Hero is that they don't explain it
this way,  they justify it a silly way.

Doesn't a magic item also give me the game effect of more power?

Why is Wealth an advantage when a magic item isn't?

Actually,  character advancement systems are generally intended to reflect
the effect on the characters' skills from "experience under fire."  It's
not their strength that's being equalized,  it is their amount of "battle"
education.  And even then,  many systems suggest giving varying amounts of
experience to each character based on their involvement or for their
roleplaying.


>The only system I can think of that *doesn't* have this is Traveller.
RuneQuest.  Sure,  characters that adventure together get about the
same amount of skill increases,  but what a character does outside the
adventure is about as important as what they do during the adventure --
perhaps more so.  For example,  I had a character who took two years off
to learn sorcery.  What did it "cost" the character?  Two years of game
time,  nothing else.  What would happen to a GURPS character that tried
to do this?  If I understand GURPS rules correctly,  he/she could only do
this if he/she had the points to spare to buy the new skills.  Gag.

GURPS does indeed have rules for learning skills outside of adventuring
that require no earned points.  Andrew, it is considered intelligence to
ask questions where you have gaps in your knowledge, such as rules
systems that you haven't read.  It is considered stupidity and bigotry to
gag at things you believe to be true about something but have only heard
them through hearsay.  Please read the rules before making any more
disparaging remarks, though questions are always welcome.

Rather than having to retract foolish words, which your parenthetical

My apologies,  Steffan;  that's what I get for posting at 2 am.  (You're up
early on a Saturday...)

I feel compelled to point out,  however,  that my comments were not meant to
insult the entire GURPS system.  While my favorite system is modified RQ,
given the choice of any rules system run "out of the box",  I'd prefer to
play GURPS or possibly Fantasy Hero.

At a quick glance (corrections invited) the poverty disads seem to
preclude the character from holding a high-paying job, and not much
else.  There is plenty of room for abuse here.  In my Fantasy Hero
campaign, I allow wealth at moderate costs.  Wealth is either holding
land or running a profitable business, and in either case comes with
responsibilities attached.  I think I can live with campaigns where
the players can buy wealth with character points.  I don't think that
allowing them to take poverty disads is going to work.

Correction - that's a *Champions* glitch, and exists for generally
good reasons.  I have *never* been asked to pay points for equipment
in other Hero games.  (Exception:  making magic items in Fantasy
Hero, or using the Justice, Inc. gadget rules, and I personally
have never done this.)

Depends on the system.  D&D seemed to be aimed at balancing strength
among characters with roughly equivalent experience points.  The
"battle education" mentioned above is, IMHO, what a character advancement
system should be, not necessarily what they all are.  The point system
exists to start out the character, and (again IMHO) should not be
maintained throughout the campaign.

GURPS does, Hero doesn't.  Any competent DM can fake something up;
GURPS experience points are close enough to Hero that the same rules can
be used.  One local GM gives PCs one experience point for each game
year that passes, on the assumption that they are doing something productive
with their free time.  It's not a bad idea.  If a character of mine
decided to go study something for two years (and had a good teacher
lined up) I'd give the character lots of experience.  This would
amount to temporarily retiring the character, of course, unless the
other PCs were doing the same thing.

In my experience with Hero games, a character has to be very
experienced indeed to affect campaign balance, and even then
it is possible for newcomers to be immediately useful to the
party.  This was not the case in my old D&D days.
I suspect that the critical difference is between class-based
and skill-based systems, and another difference between games
that allow dramatic advancement over the starting characters
versus those that don't.

In Hero, a character may start with 75 base points, and 50-75
points of disadvantages (as well as, essentially, 125 points
of free stats, 12 free points in Running, several basic skills,
etc.), so it will take a *lot* of experience points before the
character is way out of line.  In D&D, the difference between
a low-level character and a high-level character is much greater.
Similarly, in a skill-based system, it is usually possible for
the beginning character to make a suitable niche in the party
by doing something that nobody else does well, but not in
class-based systems.

No.  Not scared of any "official" label.  I just do not think that the label
has any weight in this case because it is not published.  As you suggest, it
boils down to GM arbitration, since very few have access to this "official"
rule.
There is such a difference between saying that such a way of doing things is
"official" by some obscure source and saying that such a way of doing things
should be a GM call.  One sounds like "I'm right, discussion ended" and the
other sounds like "Here's a good idea, and here's why."

In other words, I don't think the "official" label applies in this case,
and since some people worry about such, I wish the label would only be
applied when (a) it is published and (b) anyone can find the rule being 
referred to.  Otherwise, the label is invalid.

    Gee, I've read both the basic GURPS rules and GURPS magic, and I never 
saw any of these rules.  I feel that Andrew's comment points out a real flaw
in the game system.

I will instead refer you to the rule.  It is in the Basic Set, and has
always been there.  The 3rd edition pages are 82 and 83; in earlier
editions, look in Chapter 10: Character Development, oddly enough.

It starts out:

"You may also gain skills, and improve those you already have, by
spending time studying them.  Anyone can gain or improve skills this way,
as long as an opportunity for study is available."

Notice that it does not say "anyone with points saved up,"  but simply
"anyone can gain or improve skills this way . . ."

It then goes into rules suggestions, and contains the interesting
sentence: "If you don't enjoy this, *don't do it.*  Instead, the GM may
slightly increase the number of `earned character points' he gives on
each adventure, and let those points be used to `buy' skill increases, as
described above.  Then it will not be necessary to keep track of study
time."  I find this typical of GURPS rules, BTW: flexibility that the
bashers never seem to remember reading . . .

Sidebars, pages 82 and 184, basic rules, 3rd edition.  Read the Character
Development chapter.  If this shows any flaw in GURPS, it is in the 
sidebar concept, in which secondary rules and game-design
philosophy meet examples, with no clear demarcations.  I refrain from
posting a summary of the rules, since they are easily available with
the rules as printed.

Monday, 25 February 1991 15:20:24 UTC - Dave Lewis:
In the game I running, I usually have NPCs (read wizards, gods, demons, ...) 
doing all sorts of odd things with magic. One of the players is a really good 
mage himself and he often does a detect & analyze magic when he encounters some 
weird effect(Makes perfect sense to me). I've been trying to come up with some
consistant way of dealing with this instead of just winging it. The idea I'm
working on goes like this:
        1. If the detect & analyze roll is made the player gets info on
        the power of the spell (i.e., puny, powerful, god-like, ...),
        the type of the magic (we have seven different types of magic),
        and some general idea of the intent of the spell (i.e., Barrier, Trap,
        ...).

        2. If the roll is much less than the required roll, the mage can ask 
        a question about the spell that would give very detailed information. 
        Examples: "How is the spell triggered?", "What is the nature of the 
        caster(i.e., mage, god, demon, ...)?"

        3. I will allow repeated attempts to analyze, but each will require
        time one step higher on the time chart. This means that if a character
        wants to, he could learn everything about a spell by spending enough
        time. This extra time does not give bonus to the roll, but the PC
        could add more time to get a bonus.

        4. If a mage takes the time to completely analyze the spell I'll
        give bonuses dice to dispel or other attempts to effect the spell.
        Or maybe this should work the other way around: take dice off of
        a dispel if the mage has not completely analyzed the spell.

Additionally, I think I'll add two new power advantages for magic:

Difficult to Analyze (+1/2 can be bought multiple times): -5 to analyze rolls
or maybe, requires one step up on the time chart to analyze.

Difficult to Detect (+1/4 can be bought multiple times): -5 to detect rolls,
once detected penalty goes away.

Let me know what you think.

You can, though you're not encouraged to, and the GM is encouraged to
turn such a character down if he feels so inclined.  (As he should for
*any* character that doesn't fit the campaign.)

I don't think this is quite the point -- more that such a character is
going to be hopelessly ineffective in so many ways he's unlikely to be
a viable PC.  This depends a lot on the style of the campaign,
however.

The -40 point disadvantage "limit" in GURPS is mostly there as a
signpost saying "if the character passes this, he's probably going to
have serious problems being effective in the campaign."  At least
that's the way I read it.

The problem here is that point-accounting values don't necessarily
reflect the value in the campaign world to the "man in the street."
Combat Reflexes is a 15-point advantage in GURPS, but the town baker
wouldn't necessarily want it.  The point costs of GURPS advantages
tend to be weighted toward the utility to an "adventurer", whatever
that is.  Being a were is a significant advantage if you're likely to
get into combat situations, so the social effects aren't as important.

On the other hand, Joe Farmer isn't going to find being able to turn
into a combat-effective creature very useful, and in his case the
social disadvantages (not to mention the effect on his sheep flock!)
are going to outweigh the advantages he won't use.

This is similar to the debate we had a while back on SJG-BBS about the
worth of the Longevity advantage.  It would be very worthwhile to an
individual, but the point cost was *way* out of proportion to its
*campaign* effect.  SJG finally reduced the cost in the race creation
books.

As has been pointed out before in this discussion on the merits and
flaws of point-based systems, it's often hard to judge "value" by a
single measure.  Personally, I still find the concept useful, however.

I wouldn't call GURPS "grim and gritty" at all -- maybe a couple of
the subgenres, like Wild Cards and Cyberpunk, but they're *supposed*
to be that way.  I suppose one could make a case for equating "grim"
with "relatively easy to get one's character killed in combat", but I
tend to think of the word as having something to do with the overall
tone of the campaign.  None of my GURPS campaigns qualify as either
"grim" or "gritty", in my opinion.  Nor do those of most of the other
GURPS GMs I've played under.

And I generally find the GURPS rules realistic, where they can be.

Huh?  I've designed a couple such characters.  Besides, Magery is
something like a stat, really.  Having an amazing dexterity and no
combat skills is sort of the fighter-type equivalent.  Presumably the
character will make up for the lack of skill by learning as he goes,
if he doesn't get unlucky first.  Paying for that potential power
(which comes relatively quickly) isn't a major system flaw.

Now, if you give a modern character Magery 3 and the campaign won't
ever give him access to major spells, yes, the character has wasted a
bunch of points.  But the point system can't stop you from making a
character inappropriate to the campaign -- that's the GM's job.

>I'll be nice and leave GURPS Supers out of this.

That's very kind of you.  I think there are a lot of GURPS fans who'd

Back in SuperWorld, a gun MIGHT do 4d of damage.  Most supers did at LEAST 7d,

thugs with guns, and that's WITHOUT getting creative with the rules, and without

it does, it tacitly acknowledges that it really doesn't work unless you cook

The question is not whether your friendly energy projector can defeat a
bunch of normals with guns.  The question is whether, having spent points
on windblasts/heat vision/green beams of force/whatever, he or she is
competitive with a brick who checked a .50 caliber machinegun out from
SHIELD or whoever and who is carrying it around as a sidearm.  This
is partly a matter of play balance, and partly a matter of genre: those
heros in the comic books who use weapons do it as part of their own

Are you saying that supers games don't need reality warps?  If I had armored
skin and wind powers like my favorite Champions character, what are the
chances that (a) I would sew up an impressive costume and fly around
Minneapolis righting wrongs, (b) I would actually accomplish something
positive by doing so, and (c) the police would just let me do it?  Or
are you saying that the long-underwear brigade is just fine, but this
business of not forcing them to rely on their own conceptions has got to
go?  IMHO, the two things that a supers campaign should do are be fun
and keep a comic-book feel, and I think the Champions (*not* Hero)
restrictions contribute to both.
I have no problems enduring the ridiculous number crunching by the way
(personal taste), but I agree with you that Champions would not work
with the "heroic" equipment rules.

The problems with guns isn't with normals using them, it is with supers
using them.  Most normals can't hit a fast moving super-type.  The major
problem with guns in particular, is the "normal" martial artist genre.  Most
martial artists are capable of hitting each other and have little or no
resistant defenses and it is very in genre to do so.  Most of them in the
comics survive and even do rather well.  However, give one of these martial
artists an AK-47, have him switch it to autofire, and blast another martial
artist of the same type...  Odds are that such a character is now dying,
perhaps even dead.  This isn't in genre.

There really isn't a reality warp there anyway.  As per usual, if you are
playing Champions, define what you want, then buy it.  If you want all your
characters running around with normal tech items that change at will, buy
Gadget Pool:20 points, only normal tech(-1/2), all foci are at least IIF(-1/4)
, Only changeable at base or under obvious circumstances(-1/2).  Total cost
is 24 points.  Buy yourself a small gun and some kevlar defenses.  If you
want more than a 20 point gun, simply increase the size of the pool until it
works for you.  Now, if your martial artist wants the ability to pick up
guns, you have it.  However, you simply aren't going to be able to take out
a martial artist using only martial arts.

        I'm in a campaign where the PCs woke up one day
to find that they had Changed during the night, and now had
nifty new abilities (pretty much the range of powers found
in comics). The *behavior* of the PCs is different from the
behavior of comic book supers; very few successful spandex-fever
types (Vililantes are illegal, secret IDs are incompatable with
public recognition and the cops aren't nearly as stupid in 'real'
life as in comics) *but* tons of super power-selling companies,
and half the Changlings seem to work for CSIS or other spook
group. It helped that there was a lawyer in the group early on.
His awareness of the law enhanced the campaign, I feel (as did the GM.
Hi, John!). A lot of fun, if often frustrating, and interesting to 
find out just how quickly power corrupts (I myself work from high
moral ground. The Reverend was too dangerous to let live, ditto
the vampires, and I seem to be the only mind-ripping psionisist who
sees What Must Be Done).

rapidly.

Which would be fine, I suppose.  (My current edition of GURPS becomes dated
information, again.)  When it does, I would dare to call it "official."

And if it was in the errata, wouldn't this been a much better source to
quote in trying to make your point?

Just because a letter you get has the author's signature on it and the word
"official" doesn't make it such.  Why?  Because noone else is capable of
simply going out and buying this product.  And is such letter "prividleged"?
I sure hope so, I don't want you reading my mail.  The rule becomes "legal"
when it is printed, where everyone can get at it.
Compare this to the SJG BBS.  Access is fairly restricted, even though it is
public domain.  Why?  What percent of all GURPS players have access to it, as
opposed to those with access to the basic rules?  Really now, not everyone
has access to it or can pay very high fees for extended long-distance calling.
But buying the rules gives you "the rules" in a neat package.  SJG BBS is
definitely "prividleged" because most players do not have access.  For the
same reason it is "questionably legal" because people without access cannot
just look it up and see for themselves, they have to take what you say at
face value, and assume that you didn't make a mistake or such.

I want to say one quick thing in the defense of point based systems. 
Experienced role players can find them confining, and in that I agree.  But
what we don't often see from our lofty towers of experience is that the
majority of gamers are neither experienced or inclined towards role playing,
as opposed to objective playing, (hack and slash).  The point system, as
least as I have experienced it with Superworld and the Hero system, forces
you to make a three dimensional character.  It forces you to define carefully
a characters capabilities and more imporantly their personality.  Most point 
based systems work on an overspend and correct with weaknesses system, this
forces a characters with vulnerabilities, a less than "classic hero".  In
conforming with the rules, the character is forced to role play.
A truly nightmare like character can of course screw up any game system,
but at least a point based system makes it more difficult.

 I think that a lot of the problems with GURPS Povery/Wealth (and to
some extent with Hero as well) is that they're trying to lump two
things together: how much money the character starts the game with, and
how much they earn in "offscreen" time. The two are vaguely related,
but often not much for many adventuring parties, so you have problems.
The relative worth of each is also highly campaign dependant. In a
typical cyberkpunk or fantasy campaign initial wealth is quite
important and offscreen earnings not very, since characters get heavy
gains from equipping well and will be earning the majority of their
income on-screen; in a horror campaign (especially with 'unprepared'
characters), the reverse is true.

However, the use of technology is one-sided, in that a brick can
get a gun that makes him similar in effect to an energy projector,
while the energy projector can't get much technological assistance
in becoming a brick.  (Nor will a machine gun produce much more
collateral damage than a team of superheros.  If the situation is
such that you can't use a machine gun without endangering innocent
citizens, the same is true of windblasts and force beams.  This is
when heros actually have to *think*.)

OK, here is the basic reason why we have been disagreeing.  I have been
assuming that a superhero campaign will be a comic book campaign, and
you are running a campaign based on the concept that certain individuals
have become immensely more personally powerful than normal humans *in*
*the* *real* *world*, something like the _Wild_Cards_ approach.  In
the context of your campaign, you are right; in the context of the ones
I am playing in, I believe I am right.
BTW, I strongly disagree with you on the proper rules for a comic book
campaign.  TOON was set up as a game of the Saturday morning cartoons
on TV, while Champions and others were set up as games of comic books.
I don't want to start an argument as to which is more realistic, but
I will point out that they are unrealistic in considerably different
ways.  Your dislike for the comic genre seems to impair your perception
of it.

It would have helped if you had made your dislike of comics campaigns
and conventions clear from the start.  Objecting to the Champions
equipment rule as unrealistic is like doing the same thing with the
TOON rule that says a character may remain suspended in air until
he/she/it/whatever makes an intelligence roll; the rules in question
have no relation to reality, or any realistic campaign, but fit in
very well with the sort of nonsense being simulated.  If you were
using Champions or TOON as rules for a more realistic campaign,
you would, of course, change the genre-specific rules, but there
is no need to flame the rules in general.  Most rules have their
place.  If you want to play a comics campaign, Champions does well.
If you want to play another sort of campaign, AD&Dv2 will serve
you well.

With some practice, figuring point values, etc., for equipment goes pretty
fast in Hero, since you have to know what it will do in game terms anyway,
and point value in Hero is based on the game terms.  You are correct in
that your campaign conception will not work with normal-strength Champions
superheros, and I suspect some features of Champions, like Speed, will
not work well with characters that strong.
Have fun with your games, and I'll have fun with mine.

As a Side note, maybe damages were typically 7D6 in the Superworld 
games you were in, but in the ones locally, they tended to average 
five.  And defenses did NOT consistently stop a four die attack.
 
Likewise, it should be noted that in your example, you use a 750 point 
character.  Unless I misrecally, this is the top of the three ranges 
GURPS suggests starting supers at--one so high that it either exceeds 
most supers from the comics, or alternatively makes it far to easy 
for a super to start with an attack that many others cannot rationally 
start with a proportionate defense against (not all superbeings can 
justify high levels of armor/invulnerability/force fields).
 
I don't think you CAN make a Supers game that looks like the source 
works without "cooking" it.  You may be able to make one look like 
some particular sub set of it, but that isn't trying for the broad 
approach, such as Champions did.  The simple fact is that in the comics 
guns ARE potentially dangerous to a good number of people (Spider 
Man, Daredevil, the Blue Beetle and Batman come to mind) yet relatively 
few Supers carry guns, even those who are normally opponents of such. 
Guns are also only the tip of the iceberg.  How about radios?  Ballistic 
clother armor?  How about walking around you brick with a reinforced 
concrete "staff' because it gives him that extra "heft"?  All of these 
have some disadvantages over a power, but not enough to not make someone 
who is not taking advantage of them in a game while someone else is 
feel like an idiot. - show quoted text -

What!?! You mean that just because everybody hasn't received this
piece of information that it is invalid.  That is ridiculous.
Anything you want to add to the rules is `valid' because it says so.
The rules are guidelines on how to play the games, not absolute rules.


>but not everyone had access to.  As the game stands, it is not "legal"
>and therefore takes special GM permission.  
This sentence straightens things up a bit.  If you want to use any
extensions to the rules then just ask the GM.  If he doesn't like it,
you're out of luck.  However, I have seen problems with players coming
up with new and interesting ways to twist the rules to make a
character that is too powerful for the amount of points put into it.
One of the players I used to know excelled in this.  You always had to
give his character sheet the utmost scrutiny, and have him remove the
ridiculous parts of the character (or design some way to `challenge'
him.)  When CarWars was being played, he would come up with the most
outragous bendings of the rules, like buying two vehicles, one real
cheap and the other one with heavy armor and lots of cargo space.
Then he would load the cargo vehicle completely with C4 (or some other
nasty explosive) and drive it into the enemies vehicles destroying
everying except the lousy vehicle that he kept in reserve. Of course
timing is important here, but not too important.

He finally got the hint and started asking the GM about anything that
he knew would probably not pass.


>Please do not use this kind of privledged and questionably legal knowledge.
>It doesn't really help anything.
Actually depending on the information it can help game play alot.
Just make sure you ask the GM if he thinks it should be legal.

In your campaign, OK.  In current technology, it would be easy to outfit
guys with body armor and firearms, and make them into wimpy armored
energy projectors (in Champions terms).  It would be a lot harder and
a lot more expensive to make them into wimpy bricks.  I would suspect,
though, that even in your campaign, a good exoskeleton is more expensive
than a good gun.

Short-ranged hero attacks are an artifact of the rules systems.  Many
energy projectors have attacks that should be as lethal at range as
the corresponding machine gun.  Some, of course, don't.  BTW, you say
that the .50 cal has a 1/2 damage range of 1200 yards; I assume this
is some sort of lethality index.  If so, how will ricochets (which
presumably will absorb some bullet energy - bullets and such aren't

OK, so I was mistaken when I referred to your obvious dislike for the
comics genre.  I apparently wasn't when I referred to your obvious
dislike of the comics campaign genre.
I repeat:  If you are running a real-world campaign with superpowered
individual, you are generally right (although I suggest you rethink
the collateral damage of superheros - when a windblast equal in power
to a whirlwind capable of lifting c. 800 tons hits a building, outside
a comic book the effects will be devastating).  If you are running a
comics campaign, I am probably right.

You think that comics "reality" has no place in a game, but lots of
people disagree and have fun doing so.  Your argument against the
Hero restriction on supers buying equipment for cash makes perfect
sense in your game, but the restrictio makes perfect sense in a
comics campaign.  Therefore the argument is on the same level as
"Magic doesn't exist" for a FRP campaign or "The physics is wrong"
for a Space: 1889 campaign, and offers nothing to the discussion.

Three problems:  They should be *a lot* more expensive than conventional
weaponry, probably on the order of a small jet aircraft.  They are nowhere as
efficient as a brick getting a gun.  A brick carting along a gun isn't
inhibited at all.  An energy projector destroys his suit with his energy
attack.  Finally, which is a real critical problem, is the physics of this.
In order to do more damage with a punch, you have to speed up the blow.  (this
isn't normally a problem in Supers games, but you want realism).  Now either
this exoskeleton is absolutely huge, so the wearer isn't connected to any
limbs, which is absolutely awful in terms of disadvantages and drives the
computer costs ungodly high or the wearer is connected.  Well, the human body
is not designed, especially at the joints to take this.  You use the
exoskeleton once and rip your arms off and/or destroy all the bones in your
hand and/or give yourself massive hernias.  Some equalizer.

Why not?  If you are willing to accept the discrepancies in the stuff you
pay lots of money to read, why not put it in your game or one of your games?
You also implied you would charge someone for something that they got at the
beginning, but not something they picked up and kept.  Why?

        Depends on what your definition of a good gun is.  Personally, I
don't consider anything less than gauss needlers and military lasers to be
"good", and they cost quite a bit.  My players have some perverse love of 
"primitive" chemical slugthrowers, though.  I've never gotten a clear reason
why out of any of them.  The exoskeletons are expensive, though.
        In any case, it doesn't matter since anyone who wants to toss things
around is much better off buying Telekinesis than ST.

the hospital easily and 4d can kill.

        Wind Blasts don't have lifting power; they just do damage.  However
much you bought, to be precise.  I've never heard of a whirlwind lifting
an 800-ton object, but I'm pretty sure that it would do more damage than any
PC could afford. 
        In any case, the point is not how much damage you do, but over what
kind of area the damage is going to be done.  BlowHard may knock in the side
of a building with his awesome wind blast, but by this point everyone's probably
run for their lives.  (And it's gonna have to be one hell of a wind blast, too-
things in GURPS don't break easy.)  Even so, it is *expected* that he will
cause collateral damage.  No one would expect a battle with a supervillain to
leave the neighborhood in pristine condition (on the other hand, it's Bad to
throw attacks like that at normal criminals).  But if some Rambo wannabe
cuts loose with a huge gun, he's gonna kill people who don't even know that
there's a fight on, hundreds of yards away.  This is inexcusable.

        Wrong.  The restriction does not make sense, because it requires
limiting the way the players can play their characters.  The existence
of magic in an FRP campaign, or the physics of _Space: 1889_, does not restrict
the character's actions, except insofar as such things affect all occupants
of those universes.  Telling a martial artist he can't buy a pistol, or a 
Rich Industrialist With Powered Armor that he doesn't own a car because he 
didn't pay points for it, is just plain wrong.  This goes for all of the 
sillyness one finds in comic books; villains always make long-winded speeches
spelling out their plans in case the heroes escape, "deathtraps", heroes
who *never* use lethal force no matter what's at stake, governments letting 
costumed psychopaths roam the streets at will dispensing "justice", high
technology that never changes the world at large...these things are not just
changed laws of physics or the like; they require that people, including the
PC's, have brain damage.  This is not acceptable.

        As for whether or not people have fun doing it...lots of people have
fun taking drugs.  Doesn't mean they're right.

You are making two points, one about Champions and one about Comics.
Champions: Pay the points in the first place so as to be able to pick up a
pistol.  If you wanted one in the first place, why didn't you buy it in the
first place.  Most people tend to be rather certain about what they will do
if they have some time to think before getting into a combat situation.  If
your Martial Artist wants to go pick up a gun, obviously the character, if
walking around normally, is probably going to want a gun in the first place.
So, just pay the points in the first place.  Small to Large Gadget Pool if
you want to keep changing your mind.

Comics:
If you have Superpowers appear, the U.S. government is going to be able to
do *very* little.  It is one thing to hit a slow-moving(relatively) opponent.
It is another thing entirely to hit a person-sized object that moves as fast
as helicopter with more manuverbility.  Also, the government, unless it wants
to break half the constitutional laws, can't draft supertypes over normals,
can't offer more money to Supers than normals, and if you have a major
'villain' problem, what do you do?  You need to stop the problem, obviously,
but how exactly do you go about doing it without shredding the constitution
in the process.

The answer?(dunno, but this sounds about right): I don't think you can.  The
choice then becomes how little damage can you do.  Citizen arrest works
almost as is.  Draft/Recruiting of Supertypes can cause problems ranging from
Discrimination all the way upto Genocide(if there is a very high body count)

Probably the best the government can actually hope for, is to start up liasons
with well-behaved supers, give them free training if asked, pay various bills
within reason, and hope to recruit them of their own free will.  Make any
superpower a lethal weapon, so any crime committed becomes a felony.  If a
"hero" steps too far out of line, take him aside and explain that something
will have to be done soon, if he keeps doing it.

Lethal Force: I know several people who if they got 'powers' and for some
reason decided to stop people abusing their powers, would *never* use lethal
force if possible.  Also, this really isn't a very common feature of the
comics anymore, just heroes don't tend to kill people and don't think:"Why
if I use more force, I'll kill him" very often.

Right, a battle breaks out and *everybody*, including the people on the
phone and the john, gets out of the building before the side gets caved
in by a windblast.  If you want a comic-book campaign, civilians rarely
get killed in battles of supers.  If you want a realistic campaign with
supers, get real.  If a battle breaks out in a populated area, people are
going to die in great numbers regardless of whether energy beams or
guns are in use.  In some respects, a joker with a heavy machine gun is
preferable; people die all over the neighborhood, but he is *much* less
likely to kill large numbers of people than the guy who accidentally
blasts all the glass in one side of an office building into lethal
splinters.

In other words, comics campaigns are not acceptable because they restrict
the way people play their characters.  (Actually, comics campaigns insist
that people design their characters as to how they intend to play them
- if you intend to fight with a gun, you design the character that way.)
The only "restriction" is on allowing characters to change their mind
later, and that also appears in such disadvantages as psychological
limitations, friends and loved ones, and so on.
But what I find to be the height of arrogance is telling the net.world
that *all* campaigns *have* to be run as you see fit, and that there
is an entire genre of RPG that is "not acceptable" because of this.
If you are not willing to accept the fact that people have different
ideas of role-playing, please unsubscribe to this newsgroup, or at

Are you merely being inane, or are you comparing comics RPG campaigns
to crack and heroin?  Would you rather a friend of yours was smoking
crack or playing Champions?  Or are you merely saying that everybody
who plays RPGs that are "not acceptable" is not only misled but

Oh boy have the loonies come out to play this week!!!  The high schools
must be letting the kiddies play with the system again.  Hopefully this
will be short and to the point (but no promises!):

If Supers genre wasn't worthy to be role-played then HERO champs system
would not survive to the 4th edition.

If Champs was such a bad system then it would not have made it past the
1st edition black&white version.

If no one liked the supers genre why do comics (not a great media, but a
workable one) based on super heroes outsell all others combined [I spent
two summers cataloging and data entry for a local comic book store that
needed the help on their new system].

Finally if HERO is a bad system and Supers is a bad medium for
role-playing then tell me why ICE has had the largest increase in sales
the last two years (over any other role-playing game company), and the
largest net profit last year (these are facts that you can pick up at
your nearest library).

So this is a religious issue?

Champions isn't a good game because you don't like what is simulates?  If you
don't like the source material, don't like the system and (more importantly)
don't use it what are you hoping to contribute to the discussion?

And, yes, I remember the Dallas game.  The mechanics were trivial, but the game
was loads of fun.  We found the system quite useful to model several "off
camera" relationships in a fantasy game.
