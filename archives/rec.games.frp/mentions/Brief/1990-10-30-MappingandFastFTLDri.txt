TITLE: Mapping and Fast FTL Drives 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tuesday, 30 October 1990 16:41:02 UTC - Brian or James:
        I'm a bit curious how folks out there handle the problem
of mapping in games with fast FTL drives. I'll arbitrarily
define fast as more than 100 C. There are about 700 stars
within 50 ly. If [for example] you have a Space Opera merchant
ship [which seem to mostly have 15 to 20 ly/day cruise speeds]
that volume can be covered in 3.3 to 2.5 days. In a year, you can
travel 5000 to 7000 ly, a volume containing hundreds of millions,
perhaps billions, of stars. That's a lot of world stats to keep track of.
I find just the 700 stars on GDW's 2300 AD Near Star Map to be 
hard to keep track of [in the sense of figuring optimum routes, or
even generating planetary systems for 700 stars]. 
        Now I can think of a few solutions to this:
        Only use slow or very restrictive FTL drives:

                This is 2300 AD's solution. While they give you basic stats
                for 700 stars, only a small fraction can be reached using 
                Stutterwarp. My problem with this is it seems odd to bother
                with the Near Star List if only 20% of the stars can be reached,
                given the information about stellar locations available. Other
                variants on this might be a FRP using the Alderson Drive from
                Nive & Pournelle's 'Mote in God's Eye'. FTL only occurs on 
                'tramlines' connecting nearby stars and any system has only
                a few connecting tramlines. Mapping in this case traces 
                tramline connections, and the actual relative locations are
                not important.

        Buy a Cray  and learn to live with mapping 10**9 stars :)

                The nice thing about computers that they can handle some of the
                skut work in running a campaign. The bad thing is that there
                not all that many available 3-D mapping programs designed
                for this sort of application and [just speaking for myself]
                I couldn't design one myself and typing in all [big number]
                of stars in a given large volume is tedious and time consuming.

        Introduce reasons not to travel far far away

                In Other Suns, humans run the risk of trampling on the toes
                of the Great Powers if they run hither and yon in search of
                trade [This isn't explicitely stated in the FGU version of OS,
                but it seems obvious that underraces can't afford to piss 
                off the Big Four]. Other problems might be range [the drive is
                fast but the fuel consumption is faster], shortages in critical
                components [Psions in SPI's Universe put an upper limit on
                the number of FTL drives available, since the psions *are* 
                the FTL drives and they are not common] or scarcity of
                worthwhile destinations [If only one in a million stars
                has anything worth visiting for, you *need* a fast drive].
                As well, even if the means to go to the Galactic Center
                are available, it does not mean the PCs will want to go there.
                I could travel to Tokyo if I wished; thus far I haven't wanted
                to badly enough to pay for the trip.

        I'm curious what other people thing on this subject.

I agree that this can be a big problem.  One of the reasons I have always been
reticent to referee something that involves Earth and interstellar travel is 
the amount of research that needs to be done on nearby stars, in order to make
the 'universe' seem 'realistic'.  Some games help you out on this one by
providing basic data for nearby stars (GDW stuff mostly) while other games
are infuriating in that they provide a nearby star map, with absolutely no
star data for these stars other than general position, and maybe spectral
class (SpaceMaster).

The way I see it you have basically two easy solutions.  You probably have
lots of tough solutions too, but who wants to use those.

i - make your universe so 'real' that your pc's will have a tough time
traveling anywhere, let alone off planet!  Space ships cost big bucks, and the
last people they want running around on them are grotty little civilians.
If you want to travel to other worlds, chances are you will get frozen - not
because of the time involved, but because you are easier to ship that way,
you use less O-2 and less food, and you don't care that you are lying naked
stuffed between Horace and Martha Walpole from Luna One.  This approach also
cuts down heavily on terrorism, piracy and just general looney tunes on the
part of passengers who can't take the acceleration stress.  It also means that
mapping worlds can be done only when it is absolutely needed, and not when
a keen pc wants to optimize your travel time. 

ii - make your universe so 'space opera' that your pc's don't care about the
exact locations of nearby stars, they just know how many days travel it takes
from different locations.  You can keep a map if you want, but some places
may not need it.  For this you can use 'clusters'.  Habitable worlds occur in
clusters of about twenty or so.  Every 'world' in the cluster is reachable in
one normal flight (no refuel needed).  You can even introduce a kludge factor
based on the 'perils of plying the ether highway' and say that the trip 
between worlds takes 10D10 hours (or whatever you want the average trip to
take), within the cluster.  You can then make up further rules that deal with
travel between clusters, including extra long voyages, mis-navigation, refueling
and so on.

Any help?

        I don't think I've seen what I think is a logical
hazard of the 'cold sleep' travel method: the danger of lost
luggage. You go to sleep, expecting to wake up on Tau Ceti 1,
only to be accidentally shipped to Omega Ceti 7. Worse, not
only do they not want your skills as a cutting-edge of technology
enhanced combat cyborg, but since the shipping company had you
stored in a warehouse for fifty two years while they tried to 
straighten out the paper work, you aren't so 'cutting-edge'

This may sound like a cheat: Map only the "interesting" stars. After
all, most stars will be rather unintersting, especially if they aren't
the kind that's easily life-supporting.  Have stats for the homeworlds
of various cultures, their major colonies, and stats for the 'generic'
core and frontier system.

Players don't generally want to go to the uniteresting places. So don't
map them (unless you really need to).

Simple. You make a scenario or a campaign out of it. The PCs are crew in an exploration ship. I have been thinking of making a mini-campaign out of GDW's 
Bayern module(2300AD) In my opinion this is the only way PCs will be exploring and mapping new systems, ie as employees of a goverment or a research 
institution. Ordinary people can't afford to have their spaceship (if they can afford a spaceship) doing exploration if they aren't paid for it. (Of course PCs 
aren't ordinary people, and they will most likel





y do things that will result in any other becoming broke) The problem is that a star system is *HUGE* and it will take a good deal of time to explore and map 
it in any other way than what planetary orbits there are. In 2300AD the system for creating star systems is quite good and shouldn't take too long if you have 
done it before. (I'm talking about just creating the orbits, not specifics about each planet)

Well, you just have to develop stutterwarp drives that can jump longer. In my 2300AD campaign the Scandinvaian Union (ahem...) has developed a way to connect 
stutterwarp drives together so that their sapceships can jump farther and/or faster. It works on the principle that the new efficiency is the square root of 
the number of drives connected, two connected drives will give 1.4 * 7.7 = 10.8ly
4 will double the distance, 9 will tripple, and so on. You can also use this connection to make the drive faster, using the same rules as above. The biggest 
problem with this system is that you have to have more drives, fitting 64 drives in one ship for eight times the efficiency is to costly to be effective. The 
new system is also a very closely guarded secret of the SU, (Sigurd, you didn't read this!!) so it isn't available to the public.(or to any other nations)

        I already own GURPS Space. My question's really about the problem
of keeping track of several hundred or several thousand stars and the 
associated problem of 'what to do when the PCs leave the map'.

I was replying with GURPPS Space to other comments, but...
The problem of giant space is similar to problems where transportation
is available to almost infinite places (time travel, dimensional, etc.)
Component of the problem is that you work on some neat world, and they
only spend a minute there.

There are two solutions:
a) Limit the size of what you have to deal with.
b) Get a Cray to handle it and make up programs which can make up info
in sufficient detail for your liking.

B I won't deal with.
A) In Space, you must limit the number of stars players may visit. 
You can do this in two ways. Either limit the size of available stars
(ie- only a few are habitable, or only a few are within reach), or limit
the availability of those stars (ie- travel to another system is akin to
taking a trip to Nigeria. More trouble than it's worth in most cases)

It's not that big a deal. 

This is one of the reasons I DON'T run a space game. Dimensional travel
is easier to control (who's gonna argue??)

        The thing that always bothered me about Traveller's maps is
that they are two dimensional, when space is three (Increase both values
by one to include duration). The number of stars in the Imperium would
be much higher if they mapped in all three dimensions. I guess the Imperial
Cartography Service thought the ease of mapping in 2-D outweighed the 
possible profits in exploiting the stars above and below the plane of
the Imperium :) I always pretended Traveller maps were 'hyperspace'
maps with little or no corelation to actual stellar positions.
        An aside to 2300 AD players: Anyone out there know what the
separation between stars is for all the binary and trinary systems
in the Near Star list?

But James,

        When you're running a fantasy game you sureley don't map every
city on every continent of the planet, only those the players are likely
to visit during the adventures you designed.  Surely the same could hold
true for space campaigns, whatever the rate of FTL.  In short, my GM's
$.02 worth:  Script more.  Restrict the players movements without 
appearing to do so.

The only problem with that, (assuming of course that you WANT to abide by
the rules, is that the designers of the system were pointed out this nifty
trick of staging the stutterwarps back with 1st edition - by me - and they
ended up deciding that with the stutterwarp on line, whether it is being
used or not, it builds up a charge - the same as if it is being used.  I
asked "well suppose they had the drives partially dismantled, and then when
the charged up one became too dangerous, discard it, re-build the next 
stage, move out, etc.." GDW said that this would work, but would take an
exceptionally good engineer - like 8+ skill in all three areas.  The
other alternative that they came up with is the brown dwarfs, stellar 
bodies of sufficient mass located between existing full fleged star systems 
that are to cold and small to be detected by normal astronomical methods,
but are good enough to get a discharge out of the drives when approached.
Assuming of course that you could find such a body between most of the 
star systems you wish to travel.  I also figured out the tug boat method
that they put in the rules in 2nd ed. Even though they did not publish it,
I know of the only shortcut between the french and american arm of space
without having to go back to sol.  I also discovered a couple of more
stars less than 7.7 ly that they say their computer missed.  (all this
with given coordinates and ship drive technology.)

Here is the next best thing I was able to come up with.  A matter/anti-matter
fueled MHD type drive.  Basically, leave out the bulky fuel tank, and
use the existing MHD drive MW output.  You need fuel still, but only
1/10th as much , so calculate accordingly.  I've proven this is technically
feasible with the technological "givens" of their rules systems.  Also,
advanced Fusion drives such as they have listed should not be nearly so
massive.  Dink them down to 1/4 their given mass, and keep the same 
output.  

then their is their traversible wormhole.  use the power systems as
they are, then use the stutterwarp drive as it is, except have the
calculated efficiency rating translate to how well the ship can
traverse an Einstien Rosen traversible wormhole.  (See the American
Journal of Physics, 1989 I believe, and also Discover magazine about
that timeframe.)  Have the efficiency rating represent a conversion
of distance in ly to light minutes.  then calculate durations according
to how well the vessel can cover 

oops, gotta go.

Basically you have another version of the problem of spear-carrier
NPCs, buildings in large cities, or similar items that occur in large
numbers in games: there's simply no way you can detail them all.

Fortunately, this isn't really a problem.  A number of techniques and
factors make it unnecessary to detail the entire universe in an RPG:

1) Players generally don't go random places.  They tend to go
somewhere where they can get something they need ("Where's the nearest
tavern?") or where there is some reason for them to believe they
should go there (typically information passed to the PCs by NPCs or
other information sources).

In a star travel setting, players simply won't visit every system with
an M star in it -- they're all likely to be pretty much alike, and
quite useless.  Unless the GM somehow prods them toward such a place,
they're likely to ignore it.

2) Many things are pretty much the same, with only minor variations.
Town guards, M star systems, or taverns are going to be pretty similar
to others of their class.  Thus you can live with a few "generic"
instances of each with moderately detailed stats, and grab one at
random when you need to.

3) The universe is full of "boring" objects.  The crowd in the market,
the paving stones in the road, and the thousands of lumps of worthless
rock in an asteroid belt are not going to be interesting to your
players, so there's no need to detail them.  If they happen to ask
about it, make something up and make a note of it.  Only recent AD&D
graduates are likely to want to land on every worthless lump of rock,
and go over it inch by inch looking for secret doors (or whatever).

4) The players (and PCs) also suffer from information overload.  They
only pay attention to things relevant to their current purposes, and
hence will normally not mess with (or even notice) things that don't
stand out in any way, and aren't important to their current goals.


About the only case I can see where you might need to detail a lot of
systems in a "fast FTL" campaign is if the PCs were scouts or
something similar.  Other people are going to stick pretty much to
established planets, with an occasional unplanned diversion due to
mechanical difficulties or similar plot devices.  Thus, you only need
to map "interesting" places, and have a few unintersting ones if the
players go off track or explore at random.

In a "scout" campaign, you can simply skip over the months of tedious
checking of worthless systems and tell them when they find something
interesting.

Only map "interesting" stars (i.e., those with sentients on them, or
valuable resources).  When the PCs leave the map, have a handful of
"unknown" systems they can visit with enough to keep them busy for a
while, and a lot more that the PCs will find a total waste of time.

        What I see in this talk about 3-D space and the data overflow problem
is alot of 2-D thinking. The best way to handle the situation is to have the
physical facts match what is needed to make a proper story flow and/or allow
the players and GM do what role-playing the would like to do.
        If you think that this is too much to handle on the dfly, how does
STAR TREK get away with it? (Please dont start argueing over that, I only

This, however, presupposes a certain "low" level of technology,
in which spaceflight/starflight is extremely difficult.  If it is
to remain a viable option, eventually it would have to become
somewhat less expensive.

Even if they have a "map", all that map will represent to the
players anyway will be the time required to travel from one
system to another.

There's a third approach:  make your universe internally consistent,
move it AWAY from the local neighborhood (if starflight becomes
easy and cheap, after all, why would everyone stay close to Mother
Earth?), and keep just what information available that you're likely
to need in any given gaming session -- the "nearby" systems are
detailed, the "far away" systems need be much less so (and the data
from unvisited "nearby" systems can be swapped for those of "far away"
systems, should the players get pig headed and set their sights on
heading "out there").

Actually, it was the Big Five (Altani, H'Reli, Bjora, Ata'a, Uquoi).
But providing for free (well...relatively unrestricted) trade is one
of the basic reasons for the L'Doran Hegemony in OTHER SUNS.  As of
the 2nd edition, the humans will have gotten a seat on the
Central Committee Central Committee (making it the Big Six).

Only trade restriction in the game is: no landings
on inhabited worlds with pre-starflight
technologies.

As to generating the starmaps...well...that can be done with a simple
IBM PC clone (or a MAC or an AMIGA, or any other single user stand
alone machine).  For OTHER SUNS, the system generation technique requires
a bit of die rolling and a bit of number crunching (both things that
a simple computer can do quite quickly).  And in OTHER SUNS, if you
only map those stars that are "interesting" (have planets
or planetesimals) the average separation of mapped stars will be on
the close order of 100 light-years (assuming a 5 ly average
separation).  While this means a fair amount of mapping on a
galactic scale, your players are likely going to stick fairly close
to home.  And if they don't, you can always use the maps and system
data for a "nearby" system that they HAVEN'T visited for the "out of
the way system 5000 ly from anywhere" that they just happened

But that's what computers are for.  Wouldn't it make more
sense to write one module to generate the positions of the
stars, and write another module to output these positions
in a form that your 3-D mapping program would accept?  Then
add the ability for your system generation program to read
the output file and generate another file for your data base
program with all of the relevant system stats.  Add the special
notes you want to the data base, and produce a few printed
reports and bingo, you're done.  (After only a LITTLE
hard work...:-)).

In OTHER SUNS, the typical freighter isn't likely to get more
than about 3000-4000 ly on a typical fuel load.  There's also
the system component MTBFs (mean-time-between-failures) to
take into account, but that's more likely to get someone stuck
between systems for an unholy period of time fixing things.

This helps on the problem (characters will likely want to have
SOME fuel left when they arrive at their destinations -- you
can probably expect the longest hop to be 1000-1200 ly).  Of
course, in a 1200 ly sphere, there are still going to be some
4000 "interesting" star systems, of which perhaps 400 might
have intelligent life forms resident, of which 20 might have
star flight capacity (and hence be open for contact).  This
tends to narrow down the options a LITTLE in OTHER SUNS, even
though the stardrives are "fast".  (This discounts colonies
set up by other member races of the L'Doran Hegemony but
since they'll be on "interesting" systems only if the "Colonization
Board" -- the Referee -- feels like putting them there, this
should also not be much of a problem.)

On the other hand, you can limit people without visibly limiting
them.  How, you ask?  Simple: have your prepared systems sitting
there, waiting for player character exploration.  And whichever
system they visit...that's one of your pre-generated systems.

Now I'll admit that this means you probably will need 20-30 pre-
generated systems with perhaps 3-4 pre-generated encounters for
each system (a fair amount of creative work).  But because they
will run through each system you've created (eventually) it's
hardly wasted work.

This way, the effective options of the players are limited without
forcing any "suspension of disbelief" by a "your characters can't
go to that system -- I've not prepared the map for it, and don't
know what's there.  You'll have to go to this other system instead."

Or only send scouts to systems that you've already defined

after all, is going to be "interesting" enough to keep a crew of
scientists and explorers occupied for some time.

One thing that was missing from the Other Suns systems was the
density of the stars.  I have been planning on writing a program
that randomly generates a star map, generates the planets, then
have a manager that accesses this data base.
What I am asking is, given a set grid size, what is the probability
that a Star is at a particular point?

I realize that I could do this for myself, but given that you
designed the game, what sort of density did you assume?

You kinda have to make it up yourself.  SB companions are 0.1-1.0 AU
from the primary, normal companions range from 1-10 AU and UC
companions range from 1-100 AU.  Those with different coords are
at least 10000 AU apart (usually more -- Proxima Centuri is 30,000AU
from Alpha Centauri).

A good statistic is that in a cube of 10 cubic lightyears there will be
one star. From there you should be able to figure it out. (I think
that's a pretty good value)
So, use a value of 8 (cheat, in other words), figure 2 blocks by 2 by 2,
which means any given point along the grid (one point per lightyear) is
going to have a 100/8 = 12.5% chance of having a star. 

Approximately. (I'd make it 10 or 8 percent just to compensate)

That SHOULD work out relatively well.

        You know, the very existance of FTL drives is, IMHO, stupid, not

        In Star Trek, ships travel by Warp (or Hyperwarp if you prefer)
through space by causing the speed of light in a set area (in this case,
around the ship) to become faster, allowing what in most of the universe
is faster than light but in the "Warp bubble" is relatively slow.  All of
this fits in with relativity, and there is now no use in mapping because
the navigation computers (which are tied in with the Warp powering computers)
keep the ship from crashing into a star or planet or black hole or whatever.
If the Navigation computer goes down, so does the Warp computer.  And this is
only AD 2286.
        There is additionally a tie between Warp and thought, but it is

        Not to disagree with your initial statement, but 9,000 km/s
exploration and exploitation of the solar system can be pretty interesting.
Think of books like 'Schismatrix' (Before the ETs show up) or 'Birth of Fire'
or 'Venus of Dreams'. Admittedly, there's little in the way of gaming worlds
set in one system only milieus, but it *could be done* in an interesting 
fashion.

        Hmmm. I wonder what a realistic 'get me there and back fast in both
my frame of reference *and* my homeworlds frame of reference' drive would look
like...

        'You see a *long* rotating cylinder. Your instruments tell you it
is 10**9 km**3 of neutronium...'

Um, even that idea is a little silly.
FTL simply means being able to travel faster than this universe's limit.
That applies to going to a different universe with a different light
speed and popping back in, or warp bubbles, or ...

Got it? Good. And the Star Trek ideas are just as silly as many others.
How do they change the speed of light? If they don't explain the basic
premise, it's so much pseudo science... There simply doesn't exist a
method of FTL travel that fits with our knowledge of physics. (And
quantum jumps don't count because there is no known method to make this
effect macroscopic)

And that's that.

Not to try and be mean, but can you prove that FTL drives are impossible?
If haven't you received your Nobel prize for it yet?  Most of the ideas
that you are basing your idea of impossible on are only THEORIES.  For
example, it was a theory that the world was flat, but it eventually was
disproved.  Likewise, the theories that you are basing your assumptions
on may be disproved in the future.

> [stuff about Star Trek warps drives deleted ]

Well, to try and remember some ideas of FTL that I can remember:

-  a role-playing game called Universe which was out 5-10 years ago.
        The way they achieved FTL was different.  A matrix aboard the
        ship represented the way in which the universe seemed at a certain
        point.  By using a psionic, they matrix was able to be changed
        to make the matrix seem like it was at a different point in
        space.  Due to some weirdness of the field which contained it,
        the ship then became transported over great distances.
-  the Traveller and Mega-traveller systems use a concept called warp
        space.  Although it isn't stated, it seems like the warp engines
        send, and keep the ship in an extra-dimensional space where
        the ratio to our universe is large (i.e. small movement in warp
        space = large movement in normal space).
-  as far as I am aware of ( may be wrong here, so be lenient with flames )
        in the Star Trek universe, the ship that is going real fast
        creates a extra-dimensional space that is very close to our own,
        with the exception of the 'The speed of light is not a rule, its
        the law' problem as well as some other small effects that follow
        from this assumption.  This is based upon prior knowledge as well
        as the episode where Wesley was trying to create an improved warp
        filed and his mother was 'sucked' into a pocket dimension that
        was a direct result of the warp bubble.
-  in a series of books about the Humanx confederation, they could either
        go into a plus space or a minus space.  I remember that there were
        problems going into the minus space and that the plus space was
        deemed to be safer by a couple orders of magnitude.  To get into
        this space, I believe that they used a gravity propulsion system
        where a gravitational field was created in front of the ship.
-  in a book that I just finished reading called Nemesis ( sorry, the
        name of the author escapes me at the moment ), the laws that we
        know hold at less than the speed of light.  However, on the other
        side of the speed of light certain laws change that allow for fast
        space travel.  Also, they use a drive that places them into this
        space, but it requires a lot of calculation and knowledge of
        gravitational constants and the likes...

These are just concepts that I took from the top of my head.  None of these
can be deemed impossible without a qualification.  The term 'impossible
with our current understanding of the universe', I would accept.  As for the
label stupid, the proposition of FTL drives could well be compared to that
of the horseless carriage.  At the time, the people thought of it as
impossible, but were later proved wrong by todays technology.  Another
example is space flight, and yet another example is computers.


On a happier note, if anyone out there wishes to send me a list of different
types of FTL drives from different games/movies/books and a brief description
of how they work, I wouldn't mind keeping a list of the idfferent types
of FTL drives that have been hypothesized(sp?).

Remember, imagination isn't stupid, nor is it impossible, but it allows
us to create new ideas from almost nothing at all.

GURPS Space has a rather good overview of the various sorts of FTL
drives and some of the other issues in FTL travel.  It doesn't focus
on the pseudo-physics that "explain" the drive, but covers the typical
sorts of drives that crop up in the genre.  Unfortunately, it doesn't
list examples of well-known FTL in the literature, undoubtedly for
copyright reasons.  But it covers all the basic variants I've heard
of.

Basically, drives seem to fall into three classes:

Normal-space FTL:  somehow the ship evades the speed of light limit,
  and maneuvers in normal space.  (GURPS calls this a warp drive.)
  The Star Trek warp drive is the most notable example, but lots of
  old SF drives fall into this category.

Hyperspace drives:  the ship shifts to a different universe, travels
  there to another position that corresponds with the desired
  normal-space position, and then "drops" into normal space there.
  The Star Wars drive, Niven's Known Space drive, and the "jump drive"
  in Traveller fall into this class.

"Instantaneous" drives:  these are drives where the ship simply goes
  from point A to point B without any perceptible time lag in the
  transition.  This includes the Infinite Improbability drive of
  HHGttG fame, as well as Pournelle's Alderson drive, and various
  teleportation, "stargate" or spatial congruency FTL "drives".

Some drives are hybrid types, like Poul Anderson's quantum micro-jump
drive, which is technically an "instantaneous" drive, but has such a
short range that it acts much like a normal-space FTL drive.

Then there are lots of variations within the types.  I won't go into
them here -- GURPS Space has a very nice discussion of them, along
with lots of other good stuff that anyone desiging a space campaign
background would probably find useful -- I strongly recommend it to
anyone interested in the space genre, whether or not they're
interested in GURPS.

In our local neighborhood, an average separation of 5 light-years
between stars is about right.  I assumed most of the L'Doran Hegemony
to be out on the rim, so similar densities would apply there.

 JJ>What I am asking is, given a set grid size, what is the

Very small.  But...in a given 125 cubic light-year volume of
space, pretty good.  I'd go for determining the volume of the
space you're planning on filling, dividing by 125, then randomly
placing that many stars in the volume.  By the by, you might want
to check the "randomness" of your random number generator before
you do this -- and do a pairwise Chi-squared test.

 JJ>I realize that I could do this for myself, but given that you

As indicated, around 0.008 stars/cubic light-year.

Yes -- not very.  The most major changes were the removal of character
creation material (skills mostly) that is now in the Basic Set (as of
3rd edition), and the updating of the weapons descriptions and tables
to 3rd edition Basic Set rules (SS and Acc instead of PB and Inc).
Some art was added to fill out the areas where material was removed,
and most of the errata were fixed.  (Unfortunately, the
period/distance formula for planet orbits is *still* wrong.  Somehow
the correction I sent in long ago got lost.  I think the escape
velocity equation is also wrong.)

People owning the 1st edition of Space don't really need the second --
the weapons table changes were published in Roleplayer a while back,
and I believe they're also available on one of the errata sheets.
Ultra-Tech also contains all the weapons changes, since it includes
all the gadgets from Space and is post-BSIII.

Not necessarily a bad opinion to have in SF gaming.  For years I've wanted 
to create and run a realistic SF game that takes place wholely within the 
solar system, with realistic (and thus extremely variable) flight times 
between planets, etc..

But then, having adopted a no-nonsense stance, you jump off the deep end with:

Except for the tiny difficulty with changing the speed of light, which is

There are, no doubt, even more egregious flaws that a competent physicist

Seriously, if you want FTL, use FTL.  If you don't, don't.  But don't fall 
into the trap of trying to micromanage (or microrationalize) the physics 
of this stuff.  I like playing in games with magic or FTL, and I watch 
ST:TNG too, but I think it's a mistake to try to make it all seem plausable
by our current standards.  For some of us, at least, saying this or that
fantastic idea is stupid (not to mention impossible) while another version 
of it is perfectly acceptable, reduces the enjoyment quite a bit.

I don't have 2nd ed. But I've looked it over.  The primary changes are
in the area of equipment and, if you have ULTRA-TECH, redundant.  The
rest is simple cosmetics: adding errata, fixing typos, etc.  I like
the new cover better than the original, but if you have 1st ed. Space
and Ultra-Tech, you're doing just fine.

Well, I sent them the original of the orbit formula.  I believe the
problem was that it was an ASCII file, and they had trouble reading my
notation -- the problem was a minor transposition there.  I don't know
where they got the escape velocity formula.  I think I gave it to them
once, but they certainly didn't use anything remotely like it.

It's possible they used Scouts as a cross-check -- they would be
likely to have it around, and probably didn't have any of my more
specialized sources at hand.

(In case it's not clear, I was SJG's primary source on astronomy
during the playtest of GURPS Space.  They certainly wanted everything
to be accurate, and did a good job in most ways.)

i think one of the most interesting things i have heard regarding
what can and can't be done was said by a friend of my parents who
used to be a physics prof at cleveland state university in ohio.
we were talking about space travel, and science fiction, and the
idea of ftl was brought up. he started off by saying this:
   democritus (i believe he was the first) theorized that there
were very tiny, indestructable particles he called 'atoms'. for
what was known at the time, with the methods at his disposal,
he was right.

   newton had his theories; for what he new, with the background
he had, and the instruments he had, he was right.

   einstein told us we couldn't exceed the speed of light; for
what he knew, with his background, and what we know & can do
now, he is right.

   x years from now, some person, with the background & theories
further built up, may play quantum lawyer and find a way to move
something faster than light. for his time, he will be right...

   yes, true, there is more to it than this, but it does give you
a nice place to start when thinking about the future in rpgs.


   i've also always liked this quote; i don't remember who said
it, maybe pournelle or niven. this is a bit of a paraphrase.

   "if a scientist says something is possible, it probably is.
if they says its impossible, don't listen to them; time will
eventually prove them to be incorrect."

If you can find it, pick up a copy of the old Universe game--either edition.
It has a darn good map of local space (within 30 ly orf Terra).
It gives the spectral classes, x,y,z coordinates, and a not-too-bad
system of planet/system generation.

For the benefit of anyone else who asks, no.  I don't have any compact
source of useful data online.  Mostly what I did was write the tables
in GURPS Space that are used for star generation, and corrected a lot
of text.


>And, if you have it on (electronic) file, any astronomical data you have

There are some of these out in netland.  Try the astronomy mailing
list.  I don't think you'll get distance data, in general, but I think
the Yale Bright Star catalog is FTPable somewhere.


>I've looked a LONG time for a good ephemeris and come up empty handed

My three main references for playtest checking GURPS Space were:

The Observer's Handbook
published by the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, this book is
chock full of useful information.  It's published yearly, and contains
lots of stuff on the year's events, as well as various tables of
planetary and stellar data.  Definitely my favorite astronomy
reference.

The Handbook of Chemistry and Physics
(I won't say which edition -- it would date me!)  All the formulae are
in here, if you can figure out how to find them.  My edition also
contained some astronomical data, but you're better off with an
astronomy reference.

<title forgotten>
a introductory astronomy textbook by Jay Pasachoff. (I think that's
the right spelling.)  Lots of good material on general astronomy, and
has useful data in tables in the back.  Many of the formulae are also
in this text.  I believe this text is probably still in print -- try a
university bookstore.

Another good source of material is Sky and Telescope magazine, which
covers amateur astronomy, and has lots of good articles.  Sky&Tel also
sells all sorts of books about astronomy by mail order, as well as a
sky atlas and a sky catalogue.

Either Traveller: 2300 or 2300AD (two editions of the same game) by GDW
has an excellent map and accompanying booklet also.  I suspect that the
only changes from the star catalog to that are a few renamed stars 
(Neu Bayern comes to mind) - probably so they can catch anyone doing a
direct copy for commercial reasons.  If you need the map, the game may
be worth the price, and it should be a lot easier to find than Universe.

SCOUTS came out a while after OTHER SUNS, and I'd noticed that they
manage to get a number of formulas scrambled in the process of lifting
them from OTHER SUNS.  (Note also:  in the MEGATRAV book, the artist
lifted the design -- nay, the complete drawing -- of the gravtanks
from OTHER SUNS, so this isn't the only time GDW has been involved
in this sort of activity).

I believe it is somewhat closer to:

   If a learned scientists states that something is possible, he
   is likely correct.  If he states that something is impossible,
   he is equally likely incorrect.

Paraphrase of a quote by Arthur C. Clarke.

        I'm willing to bet someone else's reproductive organs it was
Arthur C. Clarke, in one of his essays. It *might* be in 'Voices for the
Sky'. I'll check tonight.

Sounds like a paraphrase of Clarke's 1st(?) law:

"If a distinguished scientist states that something is possible, he is
probably correct.  If a distinguished scientist states that something
is impossible, he is probably incorrect."
