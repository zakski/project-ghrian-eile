The "adventuring group" is a fairly artificial construct in many game settings.
Even if a group is suitable (such as a military team or several people owning a
business), having them constantly having "adventures" is a bit artificial.
Desert Storm was a short "adventure" for most military personnel.  Those
military teams did not go from that to another crisis, and another crisis, and
another....

The critical word is "never".  I posted my original message on campaign lengths
because I was surprised at how satisfying it was to end a Legacy campaign when
an adventure, task or set of circumstances had been completed.  In other game
systems I'd played in (AD&D, Traveller), we usually were disappointed when a
campaign ended.  We'd spent all that time accumulating power and other things,
then it ended and we knew we'd have to start accumulating goodies all over
again.

Again, it's the accumulation of things--physical or non-physical.  I'm quite
dissatisfied by games where the accumulation of things plays a major part.
Accumulating contacts and knowledge (ie. How to aquire illegal weapons on
Colony One.) can add depth to the game, but a lot of pleasure is gained from
trying to develop those, rather than from using them.

I suppose it's a matter of personal taste.  I consider a game in which more
power = more fun to be too shallow to be enjoyable.  It's okay for a break from
other styles of gaming, but it's not satisfying for long-term play.  This is
the reason I had to stop playing AD&D: it just wasn't satisfying anymore.

Factors 1 and 3 can depend heavily on the game system.  AD&D encourages the
premise of "adventuring groups" going adventuring for the purpose of
accumulating wealth and power.  I think it states this somewhere in the manuals
(with different wording).  It can be played differently, but this is the common
style.

This doesn't address the question of why some feel it necessary to keep a
campaign going for a long time.  When I was playing AD&D, there was no question
about it: if it was a good DM and players, the longer the campaign, the better
it was.  This gave more time to accumulate power, allies, enemies and assorted
goodies.  There were other advantages, such as familiarity with the other
characters, but those were minor.

That's true, but it has little to do with the question of the length of a
campaign.  A GM can run several campaigns in one world; the world and rules
staying the same.  We've had four Legacy campaigns in the same basic universe
(minor, inconsequential differences) that differed because of the character's
viewpoints.

Take a rpg town; the game system doesn't matter.  Keeping the town the same,
imagine one campaign with characters who are thieves, and another with
characters who are law enforcement officers.  Those can be two very different
campaigns.  Run the same players through it from both perspectives, then run
them through again with characters who are political leaders, businesspeople or
average residents: each of these can be vastly different campaigns.

Many of your other comments also apply to drastically changing campaign
universes, not changing campaigns.

Does each "scenario" have different characters (equivalent to what I mean by
"campaign"), or do the same characters continue from one scenario to another
(what I refer to as "adventures")?

The dividing line is when the reason that your character remains with the other
characters is because otherwise you (or other players) would have to roll up a
new character.  You can come up with excuses for staying together, but if the
decision is yours and not the character's, it is artificial.

That is extremely artificial.  You're trapped in a bad "adventure" TV series,
saving the universe each day, knowing that you'll never have a chance to rest
and enjoy the fruits of your labour.  How many people spend their entire lives
saving the world?  I found it very refreshing to have characters whose normal
lives are interrupted by a great adventure and know that they have a normal,
happy life to go back to.  It felt _great_ to let my navy officer go on to a
new assignment, filled with pride of having successfully completed a very
dangerous assignment.  Immediately putting him into another "save the universe"
assignment would have been artificial and tedious.

I don't consider endless "save the universe" adventures to be a glorious life.
They remind me of that character in Greek mythology who is condemned to
eternally pushing a boulder uphill, always having it roll back down just as he
reaches the top.

Not to the same extent.  If you retire a character in an "accumulate goodies"
campaign, you're making a major sacrifice.  Why is a (to use AD&D) 1st level
cleric going with a group of 15th level characters?  If it's not an "accumulate
goodies" game, the player is faced with the difficulty of pretending to not
have knowledge gained by the previous character.  If it's a completely new
group of characters, it's a new campaign and a fresh start for all.

Do they continue to play in it because they really enjoy the campaign, or
because it's hard to find a decent campaign and it's easier to just stay in the
present one?  (This isn't a comment on your campaign; merely a statement of the
flaw in your argument.)

The characters should believe they can make a difference, but also believe that
if they make one little slip, all their striving will have been in vain.  If
the outcome is known in advance, there's no pleasure in reaching that goal.  I
find doubt to be very important in gaming.  It brings out many strong emotions,
like fear, worry, horror (at failing) and pleasure (at succeeding).

That is a good reason to stick together.  The problem is when the characters
finally get home--and still remain together for another adventure, despite each
having different personal desires.  My present character has a "chief surgeon"
position waiting for him back on his home planet.  Other characters in the
group have similar reasons to part once we make our way back to civilization.
Staying together after that point would be artificial.

I don't think a character can ever get fully developed; there's always another
aspect to explore.  :)

I didn't start this thread with the desire to encourage short campaigns.  I
like long campaigns and would have loved to continue some of the characters I
had in recent campaigns.  There was so much more to explore in each one:
character aspects as well as the universe through their perspective.  However,
the point was that I wasn't heartbroken to retire them.  I was satisfied that
they were clear of a bad situation and could continue on with their lives, even
if I wouldn't have the pleasure of sharing them.

I think one of the main factors was that accumulated goodies were not a factor
in how enjoyable a character was.  A kid fresh out of school (few skills or
possessions) is just as enjoyable as a retired professional with several
Ph.D.'s and piles of expensive possessions.  It's what you do with what you've
got that's important.  In too many other games, what your character has
(skills, hit points, magic rings, etc) are more important than the characters.

Another factor was the fact that the characters weren't chosen to fit together
in a group.  The point where we stopped our campaigns were the points where the
characters would have gone their separate ways.  The GM gave us the option of
continuing; he would have thrust them into a new adventure, with a reason to
stay together.  I think we were all satisfied to end the campaign there.  Maybe
we didn't want to spoil the pleasure we'd shared in the first part.

Oh, we had quite enough complexity in a dozen or so sessions.  I was keeping
long notes on who did what when, to try to figure out what was going on and
why, and who we could trust.  We had lots of friends, associates and other
contacts: some were helpful, some untrustworthy and some died (was it really an
accident?).  Yes, it was quite complex.  :-)

I agree that it wasn't quite long enough for developing characters to great
depth.  We were only starting to get them reasonable developed in our first
campaign when they died.

I would love to start a long-term Legacy campaign.  I'd like to see how well we
can develop the characters after a year or two of gaming.  One of these
times...  :)

I accept your definition.  However, sometimes the division between two related

Maybe 1) should be "endless campaign" instead.  It is distinguished by 2) by
who makes the decisions for the characters staying together in a group.  If the
characters make the decision, it's #2.  If the players make the decision, it's
#1.

Yes, but I think that is still the main reason for many long (#1, endless)
campaigns.  There are a lot of groups out there that simply aren't aware of why
they play a certain way or of other ways to play.  The reason I started this
thread is to give other gamers a chance to examine their gaming habits from a
different perspective.  Some will say, "I see what you mean, but we like
playing this way, so we'll continue."  That's fine, but I'm hoping there are
other gamers out there who will realize, "Hey, maybe that's why our gaming has
been a little stale lately." or "Let's try that other style to see how we like
it."  I was an AD&D supporter...until I tried some better systems and had new
perspectives open up.

Well, some of us like role-playing and developing character personalities more
than roll-playing in a story.  I prefer having the characters more important
than the "story".

  What has this to do with the game system? I would think that the structure
of the campaign is the domain of the Ref only, and I can't see how the
system could affect this in either a negative or positive way. Even a system
totally lacking an advancement (experience) system will not make a long
campaign impossible.

  I would say that Traveller, with it's lack of experience system answers
this description: If then the Ref tries to "correct" this "lack" by loading
tons-o-nifty-stuff on the characters the problem resides in the Ref and not

What you put in paren's, I see as the most enjoyable aspect of gaming.
I've played lots of characters, and there are many, many more I think
would be fun to play -- I come up with new ones all the time.  But all
the possibilities are nothing compared to the few characters that I have
developed in depth over long campaigns.  And by campaign, I mean involving
more or less the same group of characters.  The best part of the longest
lived campaign I was in came when the reason everybody had gotten together
had passed.  The characters (and I don't mean players) had bonds that kept
them together.  They didn't run around in a group anymore; more often in
twos and threes.  Each character had his own goals, and he'd naturally
turned to those he trusted for help.  Nothing builds trust like fighting
side-by-side so many times you've lost count.  Even characters who didn't
like each other trusted each other.  When you *need* something done, that
means a lot.

More/better skills mean nothing to me.  When you reach a point where a
character's change in personality is not percieved by others as just
another quirk while you're getting the character down, the game's starting
to get fun.  And I find it easier to develop a character when he's
interacting with other 3d characters, so I like most of the other pcs to
be long-term characters, as well.  Also, I've found that the best npcs are
ex-pcs.  An npc whose life the gm has watched usually has much greater
depth than one whose history the gm has thought up.

If changing systems lets you run long-term campaigns only when there are
valid reasons, more power to ya'.  Personally, I don't consider that to be
system dependent.

Game systems don't absolutely enforce a particular style, nor do they make a
certain style completely impossible.  A good GM and players can probably change
any system into whatever they like.

Systems do _support_, _encourage_ and _foster_ certain styles.  Give an
inexperienced group AD&D and they'll likely form a dungeon crawl style of
campaign; that's what's written in the manuals.  Give them Harnmaster and
they'll likely form a style dealing with intrigue and politics (At least I
think that's what would form).  In both systems, the accumulation of goodies
would likely be a prime motivation for players and would make them unhappy to
have short campaigns (unless they were granted goodies at the start of each).

An experienced group can go beyond the common styles of a game system.  They
can have political intrigue and deep personalities in AD&D or shallow
hack&slash adventures in Harnmaster.  However, I do not think this level of
gaming represents the majority of groups.

Has anyone done a survey of gaming groups, measuring style, character
motivations, average campaign lengths, etc?

I thought Traveller's lack of an experience system to be good for role-playing.
Players could concern themselves with their characters, rather than worrying
about how to get more goodies in the shortest amount of time.

You missed the point.  I didn't say that Legacy characters didn't accumulate
anything; I said that the accumulation of things didn't make characters any
more enjoyable.  Our latest characters lost all their belongings, gathered new
equipment, lost it, got more...  The characters were in no way less enjoyable
when we'd lost all possessions than when we had piles of goodies 9we'd looted a
deserted city).  It's what the characters did and how they interacted with each
other and with the world that was fun.  Goodies change the interaction, but
don't improve it.

I didn't.  I said "encourage".  You seem to have confused it with "enforce".
TSR _encourages_ and _supports_ a certain style of gaming, though they don't
and can't enforce it.

I'd give the opposite advice.  :)    As an experience player, I enjoyed the
development of a new character--from scratch.  Once they'd reached higher
levels, I lost interest in them and wanted to start over again.  I found it
more fun to play a scared first-level cleric than a 15th-level high priest who
had piles of magic items and who led and destroyed entire armies.


Your use of the term "some 1st level twerp" bothers me.  From it I assume that
you equate goodies (magic weapons, hit points, etc) with how interesting a
character is.  "Now that's a REAL character!  He's got seven artifacts of
immense power!  He's much better than Joe Shmoe who has only ordinary weapons."
Equating player experience with character goodies also seems wrong to me.  Is

the player with Zoltan the 47th-level fighter-mage (with oodles of goodies) a
better player than the one who plays Joe the first-level druid (with great
character depth)?  Handling the power of high-level characters and things like
political intrigue that go along with that power may be best handled by an
experienced gamer.  However, role-playing a first-level character really well
also requires a lot of skill and experience.

You have no idea how wrong you are, but interpreting my above statement in
D&D terms makes me understand how it came to pass.  It's been so long since
I played D&D I'd forgotten what "1st level" really means, aside from my
lingering impression of twerpitude.

What I am talking about is *survivability*.  The primary problem with D&D and
other level-based games is the fact that a party *must* be fairly close in
level or the lower-level characters will almost inevitably be wiped out by
situations that are no challenge to the higher level ones.  Even the best DM's
have a very, very hard time trying to deal with this, and it is a very, VERY
powerful incentive to keep the old, powerful, high-level character in play
unless the entire group is willing to retread.

The real context of the above statement is my attempt to recast in D&D terms
something which is very easy and natural in a point system.  Characters are
built commensurate with the level of experience of the PLAYER.  This does not
equate with "artifacts of immense power", in fact, new characters seldom start
out with any magical items at all, regardless of their level.

What they can have instead is "support systems" - better skills, with more
variety; a background including more resources, such as a wealthy family, or
a patron; but all of these are oriented toward maximizing MY options as GM.
These resources provide the player with options in play, which more experienced
players can use to further the shared experience, WITHOUT turning things into
Monty Haul.

Let's face it, 1st level D&D characters ARE twerps, and it is no fun going
through a bunch of them before you luck out on one and build it into something
fun to play.  That's the way the system is designed, isn't it?  Aren't 1st
level Mages SUPPOSED to die like flies?  Isn't that what D&D calls "game
balance"? Oh, yeah, I remember playing my 1st level mage.  Ol' "One Shot".
Once he fired off that sleep spell he was cannon fodder.  Of course, he was
cannon fodder before, too.  All he can do is hope for that one chance, and
watch everyone else play.  Don't tell me it's MY gaming style, I've done too
much other gaming and tried too many other systems to think that *I* just can't
run a 1st level mage well. In my games, an experienced player can replace a
slain experienced character with another experienced character - one very
different perhaps, and I encourage that, but with similar levels of resources.

Working a *character* up from 1st level might be fun *once*.  After that,
the novelty comes from the scenario and the background, not the mechanics
of the character.  Level systems arbitrarily limit the options available at
1st level to justify their structure.  That's fine.  But it makes mixed parties
difficult or impossible.  If you don't mind that, fine.  If you enjoy working
characters up from 1st level over and over again, fine.  But if you don't,
then you must do something like I indicated above.

It's a hard concept to get across to D&D fans.  <Dave Nalle Mode Enabled> This
is something is that easy to do and unthreatening of game balance in
point-based, skill-based systems.  In D&D, it means shooting for something

This is not a flame, nor is it intended as a diatribe against D&D.  Whatever

is a walking example of D&D rules rape, and is damned hard to find anywhere
else.

<lots more stuff deleted for space.>

As a member of Nicolai's current "campaign", allow me to interject a 
comment here.  You two are not using the same definitions (and as a 
result you have made several erroneous assumptions.)  What Nicolai's 
talking about is having the same "universal background" for each game.  
But each player may have many different characters, and who goes on 
any particular run depends heavily on 1) who's there and 2) who they 
feel like running.  Some characters have been around since the begin-
ning of the campaign.  New ones can be generated at any time and 
frequently are.  Old ones may retire (or die, though that's not all 
that common.) Individual characters over the years have formed friend-
ships and antipathies, quite independant of the players who run them - 
one reason I have 20 or 30 characters is that for awhile one person 
was running a ship captain who was so inept (or at least plain un-
lucky) that none of my existing characters would serve on his ship 
more than once and I had to roll up new ones whenever it was his 
turn..  And the player is a friend of mine (even though another of my 
characters would be willing to shoot another of his characters on 
sight.)  And what characters do matters; frequently they CAN have an 
influence on the universe at large.

Your descriptions of campaigns and adventures seem to assume things 
will be analogous either to a movie, or an episodic television series.  
What he's talking about is more like a soap opera; the world remains 
the same, characters enter and depart, and at any given time something 
is being wrapped up, something else is being started, and a third 
element is somewhere between these two.  And how long any thread will 
last is anyone's guess - sometimes it can take years before all of the 
results are in.  Threads sometimes combine unexpectedly; something the 
gamesmaster had neither planned nor predicted provided the last piece 
in a particularly knotty (as in Gordian) problem, giving several close 
friends the chance to retroactively save the sanity of a mad sociolog-
ical genius whose actions bid fair to start interstellar war.  But the 
characters had NOT spent the entire year or two working on just this 
problem; mostly they were busy doing other things, in company with 
each other and, more often, in company with others.  We've also had 
characters fall in love and marry, sometimes generating all sorts of 
interesting results ranging from offspring to getting arrested for 
high treason.  We've had characters change assignments, retire (in-
cluding one epic case where a civilian character of mine went on one 
trading expedition with a crew of characters ranging from the unscru-
pulous to the unlucky, survived in one piece with a profit, and 
promptly went back to his normal law practice and stayed there!)

So it remains interesting.

Well, then it goes back to the adage in the FAQ about a good referee making
a good game, and the other old adage in the FAQ about different players 
enjoying different aspects of gaming.
Rather than quote more of an FAQ that we've all read more than a few times,
let me add that a substantial amount of character growth can occur, esp.
when the players all realize it is for a short term game.  PCs become
a lot more colorful, bold and brash when they know that they don't have to
bear their repercussions.

In another one-shot, this time at a convention, the players got so into
the characters that at least two of the players are still playing the
characters, under another referee.  No one ever said that just because
I stopped running the game (it was a 'training' scenario, so all the 
PCs met for the first time) meant that the characters had to stop their
existence.  They worked well as a team, and there were still more 
problems for the agency to send them to, so they continued together.

Ah, you're talking "accumulated goodies" gaming, where the problems facing the
characters are set according to the "strength" of the goodies they possess.  In
our Legacy campaigns, it's just as easy/fun to run a "fresh out of boot camp"
recruit as it is a brigadier general, and both can be in the same PC group with
no real problems.

I'll ask the Legacy GM's about how difficult they would find running my "mixed
rank" example above.

I didn't say anything against character resources for the GM.  I've had Legacy
characters with lots of resources.  Those resources (rank, skills, etc) gave
the characters more options than a young kid just out of school, but they
weren't major factors in the enjoyment of the characters.  There was no feeling
of "Oh good: we're getting some more skill development points!"  The skill
development points--or promotion in rank, or whatever--are reflections of the
character's actions; not rewards.

Perhaps that's the critical difference I've noticed.  In some games, power
(goodies) is given as a reward.  In other games, power is a reflection of what
a character has learned/earned from an experience.  That's not the whole part
of the difference, but I think it's a part of it.

Well, if you follow the letter of the roll-playing rules and not the spirit of
role-playing...    What you decribe (going through a bunch of characters)
sounds like roll-playing standard TSR modules.


> Working a *character* up from 1st level might be fun *once*.
It was always my favorite part of AD&D.  It was the high-level characters that
I considered fun only once, and then only for one or two sessions, until the
novelty wore off.

I'm not sure.  The decoupling (good choice of word!) is something I became
aware of only recently.  I haven't figured out what is the reason for it or how
much is due to the system, how much is due to the GM and how much is due to the
GM.  It might even be due to something that can't be directly attributed to any
of those three factors.


> Ok, Roleplaying (interaction) is your style, but isn't your enjoyment of

Some game systems make it difficult to support that role-playing style.  It may
be possible, but it takes major changes in the rules or a lot of extra work
from the players and GM.  Other systems naturally support that style and would
require similar changes to support other styles of gaming (hack&slash, heroic,
etc).

Legacy was written out of dissatisfaction with the styles of gaming naturally
supported by the other SF rpgs on the market.  Legacy lets our group role-play
in a believable future without the annoyance of intrusive rules or system
framework.  One new player remarked on how unobtrusive the rules were (he
probably still hasn't read the rules).

I see.  I've never been in that type of campaign (where you're not sure which
character you'll be playing next session).  I don't think my comments about

You obviously have not gamed a system under a GM taht can give you a reference

I assume you are concerned with the traditional *D&D game where the
players get experience points for specific acts, originally of course
killing and looting, and therefore there was a strong incentive to
do whatever got the experience points.
Hero and GURPS encourage the GM to hand out experience in small quantities
each session, modified by how successful the party was and how well a
character role-played.  In my local group, each character will get 2
experience points for a normally successful session.  This allows the
characters to improve slowly over time, but removes the distortion.

A slight clarification. "A normally successful session" is usually defined
as one in which the Earth is still in one piece, no alien race is in charge 
of all civilization as we know it OR the characters are still alive. 

(OF course, I suppose there wouldn't be much point of giving out experience
points if we were all dead.)

  I've noticed several problems with this in the gaming groups I'm associated
with.  The problem occurs whenever there is a military or other command
structure that involves orders being given.  Maybe its just my players (and
it may be), but they find this very chafing and tend to try and ignore or
subvert the orders so they can do whatever they want.  I've seen it in Aliens,
Star Trek, Recon, etc.  Player A, the high-ranking officer, says "Go there
and do that."  Player B, the object of the order, grumbles about it (if its
late enough in the game that he's tired of following orders) and then 
proceeds to do pretty much what they want.  Player A pulls rank.  Player B
gets annoyed at the scenario, and decides they don't wish to play said game
genre again.  Sigh.  Yes, yes, immature behavior.  But if you were mostly
ordered to do boring things and kept back out of the interesting plot 
elements simply because your character was a low-rank grunt, I can see where
you might get annoyed.

Once again, charging into the breech...
The system I use.  First off I quick start D&D type players.  I insist
they start at 1st but give them 2nd after 2 play sessions, 3rd after three
more sessions. 
Under normal play constraints I give out 50exp * level for decent role playing,
and other 50exp * level for saving the group, trying something and failing,
trying something and succeeding, etc.  This is highly D&D centric I understand.
I give exp for success or failure in an effort to encourage the players to take
chances and because I liked the idea since I first saw it in TnT (quick quiz:
anyone else out there remember TnT?  :) ).
I also give out a big bonus at the end of a successful mission whether or not
combat occured.  Anyway... my 2 bits.

Two.  First off, much of roleplaying is focussed on out-of-the-ordinary
situations, people and occupations....  And even then, most of the boring
parts are left out (dealing with the bureaurarcy, day-to-day living,
maintennece and upkeep of equipment, etc.)  If a campaign is to take
place in a pseudo-military setting, the setting should be such so the
regular boredom of military life is either sped by on "narration time"
or the setting should be so changed so there *is* no boring times.

Second is the story.  This is also a two parter.  The referee first.

The referee should make sure to write the story so that each player
feels his respective character has a part in the plot.  Hopefully,
all the other players will agree, and all the PCs will act accord-
ingly.  The aforementioned low-rank grunt should not just be *any*
grunt.  He should be some *special* person.  Otherwise, why play
him?  (And "no one else is around to play him" is not acceptable.
That's part of the referee's job.)

The player should enter into this unequals situation with some
expectation and a reasonable mindset.  The military mindset is to
take and execute orders.  Any character of a military heirarchy
should have been through basic training, boot camp or some other
established facility to beat any smidgen of initiative and 
rebellion out of the the character's nether pore.  This is all
part of playing "in character," what the player is here to do.

Tunnels and Trolls!  In my opinion still the single best frp ever produced.
Easy to learn, easy to play.  The manual is a joy to read with the best
art ever (Danforth, Carver).  I have two copies of the rules, and most of
the solo's, also Monsters Monsters (anyone remember this gem from the past).

This was the age when games were not designed to be realistic.  Combat
is abstract and almost silly, but oh so deadly.  Now I'm running a GURPS
campaign, and we have to check the manual every five minutes!  Give me
the good old days.

I also still have my "You missed all my vital spots" T-Shirt, but I don't
wear it for fear that it will disintigrate the next time I wash it.

my personal method of giving xp is to set up events that happen during the
session.  each event is worth X amount of xp for its completion, less if
its only partially complete.  the players know this & thus realizes that
killing things DOES NOT equal xp.  if they can solve/do something that
doesn't involve killing every NPC or monster, they won't be losing out
on xp (this btw is my main complaint about tournament games at conventions,
they're KILL, KILL, KILL, don't be smart & avoid unnecessary encounters or
you'll miss out on score points).

thus all players get a basic total from the session.  to this i can add or
subtract xp for exceptional role-playing, problem solving, heroics, etc.

also, i can now control how fast xp is given out by adjusting the xp i rate
each encounter as.  for mid to higher level characters, this lets me
get away from having to throw hordes of monsters or treasure piles out to
ensure that level advancement doesn't crawl.  (note: i still do throw
gobs of opponents, its just that i don't have to if the plot calls for
otherwise).

Even that has changed now. In purchased modules the DM is more and more 
encouraged to give out XP for role-playing, heroic acts etc, clever actions

I've never played Legacy (been through AD&D since it's inception (the
original three booklets for those who care).  However, any DM worth their
weight in EP would find a way to fit the lower level character in.  It's
not _that_ hard, and can make for some fun interaction within the party.

I have to agree.  I think it has less to do with the level of characters
and more to do with the level of role-playing.

Again, we agree, Nick.  Granted, it might be fun to send a
mumbledy-mumbleth level paladin up against a lich, but the "fun" in that
becomes bored.  It's more of a hack and slash situation.

As a ref, I always set a campaign up with the knowledge that there had to
be a flow of some type for the players to follow.  In a sense, the players
are guided along a story line (or set thereof) which I have prepared for
them.  Does it take away from the spontenaeity?  Maybe.  But it keeps the
pace of the game at a level which doesn't allow the players to become to
bored (unless they're all para-surfers and need a constant adrenalin rush
just to keep their eyes open), and it allows me to insure that I am
familiar with what the characters are going up against.  It doesn't mean
that I keep them from killing themselves, but I like to give my players a
fair chance.  After all, what fun is a game if the only thing you can look
forward to is being killed?

As a player (Boy, it's been a long time since I've been able to do either.
It's amazing what a family can do to take away your play-time), I play my
character as an above-average person in extraordinary circumstances.  You
will never hear my thief mention his profession, unless accusing others.
My magicians work on several levels, while my priests ardently work at
their various religions.  Working them "up" from lower levels is the fun
part, it's what makes for great stories.  No one gives a hoot whether your
18th level magician was able to destroy a golem.  With that much power at
hand (assuming that there are at least a _few_ magical items along with
spell resources) he/she should be able to destroy a squad of golems.
However, the story about the party of 2nd levels I was with who trapped a
were-tiger (excellently played by the ref, BTW), is much more
entertaining, because it displays wit and work.

Funny, but I've always been under the assumption that players don't need
to know the rules to any type of RPG system as long as the ref was
reasonably well-read on the subject.

The ref is the one responsible for knowing the rules.  The players...
well, they _play_.  In each campaign there will be non-standard options
(options to the ref, not necessarily to the player);
critical-hits/fumbles, deity intervention, luck and the list goes on.  The
ref should provide the players with enough knowledge of their surroundings
so they don't act like complete idiots ...

"I wonder what her face looks like under that veil," said Bjorn, rippling
his muscles in the cool autumn sun as the eyes above the face in question
watch him appreciatively.

"You won't know, lad," Mattock said, his dwarven whiskers twitching in
silent laughter as he playfully punched Bjorn's knee.

Bjorn winced.  He wished that dwarf would learn his own strength.  Through
the tears he forced his voice not to quaver, "Why not?"  His hand went to
his sword pommel in reflex to the possibility of a challenge.

Mattock, still chuckling, pulled out a scroll from his belt, "It says
here, third paragraph, 'The women of the Kchichtloch highlands who wear
veils are considered a special treasure by the community.  Outlanders
caught gazing on their beauty are automatically sentenced to death.'"  The
dwarf put the scroll away, "Remember?"

Bjorn rubbed his knee.  "Oh."

I have played in campaigns where the players are dropped in a city, or
wilderness, or whatever, and are expected to find out information about
the surroundings and where to go for adventure, without any knowledge of
the surroundings, the people, any of the customs, or any legends at all.
As a ref, I try to make sure that people know everything that they should
know (assuming that these people are adventurous and would want to know
something of the outside world as they lived their dreary existance),
mostly general knowledge; North is actually South, but we call it North
anyway, or stuff like that.  Beyond that, the player need only know how to
play their character.  I have to decide whether they actually have enough
time to place five arrows in the ground before them while lighting their
lantern and wrapping strips of cloth on the arrowheads that they're
dipping into the oil or not (Not!).  I can tell them how far they get, but
I try to be subjective about it all.

As for carryable weapons and such,  I can still remember the time that I
played in a campaign in which a person tried to convince the ref that he
was was taking his _spetum_ out of it's sheath in a 10X10 corridor.
Pretty ballsy stuff for a sixteen foot long weapon.  I wanted to see the
sheath!

The point is, used properly, the rules are a control item for the ref to
insure that there is some actual challenge to the game.  In combat, it is
best to use the KISS method (Keep it simple, stupid).  For instance, in my
campaign I have critical hits and fumbles.  Roll a 1 and it's a fumble
(ref's choice, anything from a simple drop your weapon to the weapon
breaks), if total to-hit score is five over what is needed to hit _or_ a
natural 20 then it's double total damage.  All of this is easy to access
and only requires the occasional glance at a to-hit chart, while insuring
that _anyone_ can get a critical, if their luck is right (and sometimes,
if the mood is right or the party outnumbered by a horrendous multitude,
I'll fudge a bit).  During campaign design rules give the ref a reference
to use or can help to speed up what might otherwise be tedious.  If rules
tend to be obtrusive, then it's because the ref isn't using them right.

I have always felt squashed in campaigns where the ref prepared a scenario
and you had no choice but to play it out for him/her.
I have even been in campaigns where the ref had a high level NPC force the
PC's on an adventure on a regular basis.  I did not stay in those campaigns.

That _should_ be the case, but in many game systems, the rules do intrude into
the game.  Take AD&D for example, since that's what you use:  MU's can't learn
to use a sword or axe "because the rules say so".  Fighters have to bash doors
down; they can't learn to pick locks.  Restrictions like these disrupt the
role-playing aspect of gaming.

Sure, a good GM can alter the rules, but that means that the original game
system was flawed.  I assume that GM's would rather spend time on creative
campaign design rather than on fixing flaws in a game system.

I personally prefer lower level gaming, but I think the critical point is that
gaming fun is not necessarily a factor of character level.  A first level MU
with one spell in a tough situation can be a lot more fun than an 18th level MU
with every spell and a bag of holding filled with artifacts.  Other factors,
such as personal gaming style preferences are more important factors in which
situation is more fun.
