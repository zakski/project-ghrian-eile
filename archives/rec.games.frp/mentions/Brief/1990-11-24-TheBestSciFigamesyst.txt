If you want to be honest about things, any sfrpg that is set more
than about 60 or so years in the future is going to be hopelessly
out of date (in its description of technology) likely long before
the year the game is set in. Other than the obligatory FTL drive,
virtually all of the games I've seen (INCLUDING MY OWN GAME) have
had remarkably little in the way of (dare I say it) realistic new
technologies?

I explained away the lack  of biosciences (no genetic engineering
in the  OS campaign) in my game by  handwaving (cultural taboos).
But I missed the possibilities of nanotechnology  and ignored any
possibility of direct  brain-computer linkage (no cybernet runner
types).

No one is going to hit all the bases in this business.

(Not that I'm  excusing the TRAV  computers, or the hopeless lack
of  understanding of politics, society,  biology, and  physics of
the  GDW designers.   Just saying that even the ones who try REAL
hard to do a good job are likely to fall flat on their faces.)

Well, I like OTHER SUNS, but then the fact that I am married to the
designer (and contributed to the game myself) probably takes me out of
the category of unbiased source. :->
Mostly what I like is the fact that you have the opportunity to run many
different species as player characters without a lot of hassles.  And that
the primary focus of the game is not forced to be combat or something
similar.  Though it's possible to get into fights, the local campaign runs
heavily to exploration.  There isn't much in the mercantile end, but there
will be as soon as I get finished putting my own universe into supplement 
form. 
(The Teklenan is a trade league rather like the historical Hansa in some
respects.  I'll post some of my working notes in here if folks are
interested.  [no, it isn't much like Poul Anderson's Polesotechnic league,
even though we have drawn from similar sources.])

Reminds me of a quote (forget by who, and it's paraphrased, sorry!)
Authors who write predictive fiction are applauded and congradulated by
the populous on their foresight and wisdom, all the way to their grave.
Then the bastards go on to do something completely different.

Hmm. Wish I could remember it better. Point is, almost no predictions
are right. Some predictions are projected too far, some too close. <sigh>

Other problem: Hard to make a society anything like ours when you think
of tech past about 50 years. Which is accurate, but strange.
