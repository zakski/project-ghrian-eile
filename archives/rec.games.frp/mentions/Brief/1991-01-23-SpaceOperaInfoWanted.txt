        Sounds to me like you're not using your head, and relying on the 
books to much.  If you've got the OLD space master set, what you've 
essentially got in your hands is the follow up to Space Opera.
        Space Opera is a good system, if (and this is a REALLY BIG 'if') 
you have the system completely memorized.  Like AD&D, you must know the 
rules backwords and forwards to use it completely.  It is unwieldy, 
difficult, and averages 1.126 typographical errors per page (I have a 
friend with every error highlighted).
        What you may be missing is The Space Master Companion.  This 
absoultely neccesaary little tome adds quite a lot to Space Master, 
including mecha and more psionics lists.  Trouble is, the first edition 
of Space Master was recalled by ICE in favor of the new, "easier" version 
of SpM that loses a lot of the flavor of the original, and the SpM.C. is 
REALLY hard to find.  I find my copy at a used gaming store.
        If you really like SpO, go for it, but it's another that you'll 
only find used.  I'd recommend photocopying a couple of item construction 
and definition sheets from SpM Ed 1 and translating the toys in SpO you 
really like.
        If your players like others, have them do the same.

I'm afraid the publisher, FGU is no longer with us.  Of course they're
the same folks who published Other Suns and there are still copies of
that floating about so you may get lucky.  (You also might like OS -
it's a space game, contains a lot of aliens and details about same.)

        Hmmm. I wonder where my distributor is getting his restock of 
FGU games, or who it is that answers the phone at (602) 497 9809, or
who it is operating out of 

        Fantasy Games Unlimited
        PO Box 1082
        Gilbert, AZ 85234
        Contact: Scott Bizar

        Did you perhaps mean 'No longer with us' in the sense of 
'not in this region', or 'really screwed up distributing our fine 
SFRPG 'Other Suns' to the point where we took the rights back',
both of which I have no argument with, or 'out of business'?
If they *are* out of business, who's cashing my suppplier's checks?

        Perhaps they are moribund, and perhaps they haven't produced
anything new in (God) years, but as far as I know, and I speak as a
store owner, and someone in the whole 'supply and demand' circuit,
FGU is nopt out of business, unless something changed really recently.

        This is the *second* 'Company X is out of business' rumour
I've seen this month. What is it, some kind of plague?

Having been told by Scott Bizar that FGU was going out of business as a 
publishing company, and existed only as a retail store, we took him at his 
word.  He even told me that he no longer had money to reprint V&V (the REAL 
bread and butter product of FGU).  Scotty was still running the retail game 
store last I heard, but he had told us that he was out of the publishing 
business.

 JD>FGU is nopt out of business, unless something changed really

Unless he's decided to start reprinting things, Scotty (and hence FGU) is 
out of the publishing business...

        Hmmm. I wonder what his backstock is like? He might not be *printing*,
but he seems to be still *selling* FGU stuff. Perhaps he's best seen as a 
distributor, rather than a producer these days?

        A real shame if true. V&V is a nice simple SHRPG, and C&S is the
only FRP known to have caused hemorages. *Tricky* magic system.

        A question: someone mentioned they'd seen a lot of FGU material show
up recently. Is this happening *everywhere*?
