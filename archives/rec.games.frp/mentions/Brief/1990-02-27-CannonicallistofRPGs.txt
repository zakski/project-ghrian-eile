TITLE: Cannonical list of RPG's 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tuesday, 27 February 1990 12:01:27 UTC - Richard J Cox:
In reponse to various requests following my posting of lists of SF &
Other rpg's, this is an attempt at producing a cannonical list of
rpg's. The games are divided into three classes:
          i) Fantasy (generally have magic),
         ii) SF (Generaly high-tech/space travel),
        iii) Other (Historical/Horror/Anything else really).
The divisions are fairly arbitary in some cases (eg should Aftermath
be in the SF list), but I feel they are divided my fairly well.
        Originally the fantasy list was posted to rec.games.frp by
ich...@codon7.berkeley.edu <> (Elliot Wilen) (for his fantasy games
survey). the other lists were created one (very busy) lunch time by
members of the UWSF&FS (University of Warwick Science Fiction &
Fantasy Society), especially Sam Dodsworth & Flasher with help from
others too numerous to mention.
        Thanks also to those who replied to my original posting of the
SF & other lists, these include:
Doug Seay <seay@edu.ncsu.shumv1>; Walter Milliken <milliken@com.bbn>;
Andrew C Durston <acd@com.att.hotld>; "John J. Lang" <lang@com.hp.fc.hpfcso>;

I seem to remember something by this name from Isaac "Real Magic" Bonewits,
but I don't remember it as a whole game, only a set of guidelines for using
magic in an rpg. What can anyone tell me about this, as I am clearly missing
a lot.


>Spacetime (b???? Tactical Research Center)
If, as has been guessed by someone, b???? is Blacksburg (as in Va), I would
be quite interested in information on this bunch (mailing address, etc), as
I am from Blacksburg, although I have been rather out of touch the last few
years...

Actually, this is Albedo (one 'e'), from Thoughts&Images, with the first
packaged adventure coming Real Soon Now.

And I believe this is supposed to be Other Suns.  Not only a nifty game, but a
great source for stories and characters...

And no longer by FGU. Niall Shapero's contract with them provided that
the publishing rights reverted when FGU let the game go out of print.
As of last month, he was still working on revising and updating the
game (there have been a number of changes in character creation and
the skill bonus determination, for example).

Some missing info for your list:
FTL 2310, Fringeworthy, Stalking the Night Fantastic (not listed) and
an after the holocaust game whose name I don't remember all use the
same system and are (or were) published by TriTac games.
Also, Geriatrics Wars, Escape from Westerville State, and several
other silly little pamphlet RPGs.

There was a small distribution historical dark ages rpg called Heroes, published
in England by Tabletop games, who usually do miniatures rules.

Creeks and Crawdads  by Crustaceum Games  - definitely in the "other" category.

Warlock  - published in The Spartan and then again later as a rulesbook by
itself, can't find my copy to get the publisher. fantasy

Another one to add (though I don't know what category...):

Synnibarr, published by Real Dream Inc.

It's a science fiction fantasy combo, with a reality level about the same
as Champions and character power level starting at roughly Champions
level and rising rapidly.

Synnibarr was written by a Seattle resident, and is available at a couple
of stores in the Seattle area and at some conventions.

Wednesday, 7 March 1990 23:02:20 UTC - Dennis Francis Heffernan:
        RE Canonical list of RPG's; Thieves' World
        There was no Thieves' World RPG per se.  Chasium put out a multi-system
supplement that covered the first two books, and a companion booklet to that 
for the third book.

        The Gamelords product alluded to previously was Thieves' GUILD, and 
also mostly consisted of a series of modules.  Towards the end of their
corporate life they put out a more-or-less Theives' only RPG, but never got
around to expanding it to cover other classes.
