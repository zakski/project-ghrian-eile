TITLE: Numbers to fuel the split discussion... 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Friday, 11 January 1991 16:39:02 UTC - Michael C. Smit, Hardware:
It is a good feeling to not care about a split of r.g.frp.  However, I still
have followed the discussion.  Kudos goes to the r.g.frp role-playing game:
my alignment is apathetic uncaring.  :)
Whether or not the split is approved, I'll still read the group(s).  But I
have noticed that while people talk about bandwidth, and "30 to 60" messages
daily, no one has bothered to actually check it out.  So, I found a dormant
account, and tried to read r.g.frp from scratch.  Mostly using "=" (a boon
equal to that of the kill file), I made a tally of the messages.  Note that
your site might have different numbers: this is just on the uw node.

And please, no flames.  My flameproof underwear is on back order.  :)  The
only thing that will get me mad is if r.g.frp is cancelled entirely.  What
happened here at U of W (when administration deleted the entire alt.* tree
because of a complaint about a post in alt.sex.bondage, and then tried to
deceive the students as to the reason (financial), finally reinstating most
groups after a public outcry) proves that the users are really the people
who determine the direction of the net.

From December 27, 0:00am, 1990 to January 11, 10:00am, 1991:

390 messages over 15 and a half days.  Average of 25 messages per day over
the holidays when most students don't have net access.

Following the most popular (in posts, at least) way of splitting r.g.frp:
rec.games.frp -- 215 messages
rec.games.frp.stories -- 24 messages (incl. Jayhawk, best use of spell, etc.)
rec.games.frp.ref -- 54 messages (incl. Merakai, Other Suns, net.book, etc.)
rec.games.frp.split :) -- 97 messages

rec.games.frp -- 55.1% of total postings
rec.games.frp.stories -- 6.2% of total postings
rec.games.frp.ref -- 13.8% of total postings
rec.games.frp.split :) -- 24.9% of total postings

Note: I haven't looked at actual lengths of messages.  Somebody with a faster
newsreader and more time than me could check for the average length of posts
in general and in each proposed group split.

But:

I doubt everybody would post their "best use of spells" in .stories --
the question the brought that up would have posted in .frp.

I'm beginning to agree with others, here -- stories won't need its own
group, representing only 6% of the postings.  We need two groups:

BREWSTER'S MODIFIED SPLIT:


rec.games.frp.gm <http://rec.games.frp.gm>        reference materials, rules mechanics, etc
rec.games.frp.players        everything else and the kitchen sink
As before, articles of interest to both groups should go only to
players.  As this rule would be self-policing (the ancient red netters
would tell the newborn not to cross-post), neither group would need a 
moderator.

Two groups is better than three for the net.paranoid (like me)...
Two groups is better than one for the net.splitters (like me too!)...

I would be willing to sign onto a 2-way if it was more general like.
r.g.f.misc
r.g.f.resources

Well, if there IS a split, this is my recommendation for how to
do it:
rec.games.frp or frp.misc  for the usual rubbish
rec.games.reference        for those gol durn net books, etc.

Of course, this is only if there is a split. I would rather there
not be one, maybe just regular posts on how to press the "k" key,
and lessons on how NOT to be offended by articles you aren't 
interested in. Yeesh. Is it that hard to skip articles you don't
like?

Well, I think I am up to $0.04 on this one.

I am not a gm... I flee from gm'ing.  Yet I would read the gm group.
Why?  Because I am very interested in game mechanics and reference
materials... although I am not good at plotting adventures, I love
worldbuilding.

Possibly I would subscribe just to 'see what the gms are up to'.
(There was an earlier suggestion that gms could post secret discussions
of their worlds in the gm group; I can't remember who said that, but
it seems to be unworkable and unfair to players.
        "You can't read this group."
         "Why not?  It's a public group!"
        "It contains secrets of the game you're in."
         "But there are interesting non-secret things here, too!")

I would, of course, read the players group, both because I am a player
and because it contains "everything else".

I would now be reading the same amount of articles spread out into
two newsgroups.  Is this better?

How many players would *not* read the gm newsgroup?  All but one of
the gamers I know are interested in game mechanics and worldbuilding
to some extent.  How many gms would not read the players newsgroup?
I don't know a single gm who doesn't want to just *play*, but all of
those stupid non-gms (like me) keep demanding adventures....

I think that the result of this split would be that almost *all*
of the current readership would subscribe to both groups.

I think the split would break up much of the brainstorming effect
of the current group as discussions move from, say, game mechanics
to nifty results of said mechanics.
        "That reminds me of when...."
         "Move it into rec.games.frp.players."

This would probably increase the volume and flaming overall, and
decrease the signal:noise ratio.

(I agree that any split should not require a moderator, merely
because the job of moderating frp groups is not one I would wish
on anyone.. the volume is high and the interests diverse.)


>Two groups is better than three for the net.paranoid (like me)...
I do agree with this.


>Two groups is better than one for the net.splitters (like me too!)...
If we must split the group, two groups is probably the optimum number,
but I think it would be better to split the group in such a way that

        a) subjects aren't constrained or likely to 'wander' in a
           confusing way between groups, and

        b) a significant (what's significant?  Maybe 5%+?) group
           of people could unsubscribe to one group or the other
           because they are not interested in the subject.  The
           split should be a labor saving device.

If people do not share my opinion that it isn't worth breaking up the
group if both of the resulting groups will still be read, or my opinion
that the majority of people would read both groups, please post; I'd
like to see differing worldviews.

No it is not.  But I would like to see the good stuff such as the stories,
net spell books, etc. get archived.  But no one wants to archive a group that
consists of so much junk and noise.  I often see messages asking how to get
back articles, or where there are mail archive servers for things, but not
everyone knows.  If the group started to become archived at a popular site,
everyone could be happy.

Yeesh, would it be *that* hard to read 2 different groups?

Except that GMs and players are not mutually exclusive groups.  Players
in one game may well GM another.

As has been mentioned in here by several people, there is a newsgroup
out there designed for discussing new newsgroups or partitions of old
ones.  If people really, sincerely, want to cut down on excessive
messages in here, why not take the entire split argument there?  THAT
would do more than any division into multiple subgroups.
