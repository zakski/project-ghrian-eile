TITLE: Campaign Lengths 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wednesday, 29 January 1992 05:03:54 UTC - Nick Janow:
When I played AD&D, the campaigns seemed to run until cancelled due to the GM
moving away, school ending, etc.  Such campaigns could go on for years.
I noticed that our Legacy campaigns (four so far) have ended after five to ten
sessions.  This was because one "adventure" ended and it made more sense to let
the characters return to a normal life than to foist another adventure on them
or +0keep a group together beyond the circumstances that initially brought them
together.  We then went on either to a new campaign under the same GM or under
a different GM.

I assume this ability to have satisfying short campaigns isn't unique to
Legacy.  The resistance to ending a campaign may be limited to games where the
accumulation of whatever (levels, magic, etc) is the main goal.  Is my
assumption true?  What is the average number of sessions in other systems that
players are satisfied to end after?

The main reason I can see for long campaigns is the accumulation of something
by the players which makes the characters more fun.  In AD&D, characters
accumulate levels, money and magic items, so for many players there is a strong
incentive to keep their characters as long as possible.

We had little trouble in letting our characters retire from gaming, since under
the Legacy system, characters do not accumulate anything that makes them more
enjoyable than a new character (other than character depth).  Higher skills do
not make a character more enjoyable than one with lower skills; other factors
are more important.

Of course, there is nothing preventing continuing a Legacy campaign for long
periods.  A campaign could continue for several years, with the same characters
or with players dropping one character for a new one, according to the
situations.  A group of characters with a joint investment, such as a merchant
ship or mining operation, would have good reasons to stay together for many
years.

There are several reason in favour of short campaigns.  One is the avoidance of
artificial situations.  It made sense for a physicist and a navy captain to
work together on an assignment, but why would they stay together after that
assignment is completed?  The artificial reasons can get a bit tedious and
unbelievable after a while.

Another reason is that in rpg's where combat is dangerous, it would require a
lot of intervention from the GM to keep characters alive (unless they limited
themselves to non-hazardous situations).  Again, the artificiality of the
situation can reduce game enjoyment.

Yet another reason is the reduction in workload for the GM.  Instead of trying
to keep the characters alive and together and interested for a long time, GM's
can offer shorter, but more intensive and creative campaigns.  GM's can also
get a rest every six months to a year, letting another GM run a campaign
without interrupting one in progress.

One more reason.  We've ended some of our campaigns feeling _satisfied_ with
the state of our characters.  They've done heroic deeds, fought difficult odds
and won, thought themselves out of tight situations...and can then relax a bit,
go on to other things and reap the rewards of their actions.  There's no
feeling of "just two more sessions and I'll have enough <something> to be
<whatever>?"  We had the choice to continue on with those characters in a new
campaign, but we chose to retire them.  I think we were all a little bit
surprised at that feeling, having been used to other rpg's.

Anyways, I haven't seen any discussion about this topic here before, so the
response could be interesting.  What do you feel about campaign length and
factors that affect it?

        This situation probably depends a lot on the premise of the game
        itself. If PCs are brought together to become an 'adventuring'
        group, rather than to solve a specific instance or problem, then
        they will be less likely to break up after 1 adventure. The Players
        also may want to either break the group up or continue based on the
        results of the adventure ( did they enjoy it and were they satisfied
        with the results? ).

        My players are never satisfied with ending a campaign even after
        just a few session. This maybe due to the open-ended-ness of the
        campaign/scenarios that I devise. There is always something to do...
        Gaining levels and skills is an influence but gaining items, magic,
        money, titles and power in the game world is fun as well.
        My shortest campaigns were a 6 session Rolemaster offshoot which
        died, admittedly, to lack of GM interest and a 12 session Cyberpunk
        game that came to a close although some players still want to continue
        the game to this day.

        NOT! I know alot of players who enjoy their characters becoming more
        skillful especially in a skill or skill/level hybrid system ( such as
        Rolemaster ). Also doesn't accumulating wealth, status, friends, items
        and relationships make PCs more enjoyable? Hell, yes. Of course if this
        falls into 'character depth' then I type corrected.

        The GM should avoid the artificial situations at campaign onset unless
        the players want such a situation and want to work around it.

        Players should be aclimatized to playing differently in dangerous
        systems ( Cyberpunk, Rolemaster ) versus non-dangerous ones.

        For some GMs ( such as me ) the reverse is true, it takes me a while
        to get into running a group and therefore be creative. It takes a
        while to stoke the forge as it were. I've been running several campaigns
        in one game world for 4 years and I think my creativity continues
        to expand and improve.

        Campaign length, as I said, depends alot on three main things -
        1) Campaign premise/why are the PCs together?
        2) The Gamemaster/being creative and willing to continually run
        3) The Players/enjoying and contributing to the game.
        Now this could be a 1-shot to a 10 year epic and the system doesn't
        really make a difference in my mind. I could just as easily be
        running AD&D or Dragonquest instead of Rolemaster.

The campaign I'm in right now has the possibility of going on for several
years.  The GM (AD&D) started our characters off with a basic letter delivering
mission to a dwarven keep about three months travel away.  On our way there
we uncovered crypts, a town called Wolfsburg (where you weren't allowed to 
go out at night :-), we met some interesting people who have decided they want
us all dead;  our cleric at third level accidently put on a ring which made
him the bishop of a church in the area (so he has to deal with that); we spent
three days with a group of vampires, flew on the back of a white dragon that 
we helped, arrived at our destination only to find it under siege, and we
finally got in to deliver the letter (which by the way, was blank.  We were  
used, while the real letter was delivered by the guy who gave us this one).
Two characters also discovered they were sisters, and are now going to find 
their dad off in province.  Oh, did I mention there is a HUGE war going on?
There was enough going on that not one player ever felt like dropping out after
six months.  We finally completed our "mission," but we found lots of other
neat things to do along the way, which many of us are going to go back and
investigate further.  I made friends with a were-rat who kinda needs help, so
I might go back and help him.  I also want to check out "Wolfburg"....

So I guess the point to this is that a campaign can go on for as long as its
interesting and new things are happening.  We rely on a lot of role-playing
so that  keeps it lively.  I expect this campaign to last a few more years,
and it'll only be packed away when the DM is just burned out from coming
up with things that were listed above.

        I have found "goals" to be a very useful reason for
sustaining a campaign.  Our AD&D GM wanted to get us to a level
where we could have a castle (and subsequently he could destroy
it....heheheheh) and so we continued playing.  Most of the campaign
revolved around a magic box.  By placing different keys into it the
box could do a variety of things.  Everyone wanted the box.
Everyone thought we had it.  Everyone wanted us dead.
        The box actually affected the campaign maybe ever third or
fourth session (or more) when someone would attack us/hunt us
down/whatever, but it gave a sense of reason and purpose to the
game.  In the meantime we were off looking for money, levels,
adventure, etc.  Fun (moreso when beating the crap out of evil
clerics...well...I preferred the role-playing aspects...sigh), but
not necessarily very logical.
        As for continuing space games...why not?  (Star Trek,
anyone?)  If one is the member of the military or government, it's
simple enough to say that everyone's been recruited as a special
team for deep space exploration or what have you.  Characters can't
just get up and leave because they've been assigned (possibly
permanently) on that "mission" until it's full completion.
        It's doable, IMHO.  Or perhaps the group is brought back
together again after a few months to tackle another problem "because
the government was so impressed by the results from their last
mission."  Etc.

        As for the cyberpunk game I run, we get together maybe once
a month to play out a session.  They're not necessarily connected in
any way, but it's the same characters.  Various things come up to
get them involved in one thing or another.  The players have certain
goals...get out of the hell-hole that passes for home, make some
money to move into the bigtime, etc.
        And I'd like to add that there hasn't been a single generic
cyberpunk plot in my games.  No AI's.  No one does corporate
extractions.  No, "we got this cool datachip from BLAHBLAHBLAH
Industries and we're trying to sell to to DUH Corporation."  There's
at the very most maybe one combat every game.
        And it's a hell of a lot of fun.  (Little do they know what
I'm going to do to their nice little condo...)  I've got a fairly
huge writeup of everything about my Cyberpunk world (another good
reason for a continuing campaign -- you get to show off all the cool
stuff you made up.  And less time's wasted on making new
characters).  I've got a basic timeline that goes twenty years into
the future of the current game.  It's amusing to play with the same
group in a different gaming session and to have them say, "Wait!
We're in the FUTURE?"  Ah...

Back when I played AD&D variants in high school and college,
extended campaigns were the "norm", in the sense that everyone
(GM and players alike) went in expecting/hoping for the game to
continue for months.  Shorter games were almost always games that
suffered from player boredom or from GM burnout.
Now I play with a group where shorter games are the norm; each
game is scheduled to run for a few sessions, and after that the
GM may run the game for another group of players, or may play in
another GMs game, or may run another adventure with some of the
characters from the first adventure and some new characters.  I
like the flexibility to try new characters and new genres that
this style of play allows.

Our group, also, had to set a limit on session length. We currently allow
a GM to run for three weekends. This has actually produced more interesting
and concise games. It also allows, in our group, other GMs to run games
with greater frequency. So far, our group really likes this. Restrictions
of this nature seem to really help groups with multiple GMs in them.

Give 'er a try!

 The shortest successful campaign I've ever run (aside from one or two one-
session stories) was a Cyberpunk story around Hallowe'en last year.  (I told 
the players that it was Cyberpunk.  What I didn't tell them was that it was a 
horror story. Forbes: `Hey, do you suppose that this guy really is a vampire?' 
Powell:  `Nah.  Come on, this is _Cyberpunk_.')  It lasted about six sessions 
and four weeks, and ended with one PC dead, two criminally insane, and the rest
choosing to let the vampire go (heh heh -- Charismatic bugger, he).  Everyone 
was content to leave it at that (but one player will still play her character 
when she gets the chance).
  Oh, and about atmosphere.  The last session of this campaign (Hallowe'en
night, oddly enough -- heh heh) before we began I arranged several pieces of a
broken wine glass on the table.  Set the mood, let me tell you. 
  Vincent, et al.

Thursday, 30 January 1992 06:12:16 UTC - Bryce Koike:
        Alas!  The short campain!  (Or worse, the 1-night game...)
        Ok, I must admit that I'm biased against them.  I hate
working up a character that I really like only to have him "retired"
after the 3rd gaming session and forced to make another.  (I've got
a folder chock full of Cyberpunk characters from one-shot games.
They were fun, but I was always sad to see them go.  Of course I've
immortalized them in later campaigns...)
        I find this to be a major problem when using game systems
that require a bit of conscious thought over character design.  (I
mean, how hard, really, is it to create an AD&D character?  It
surely shouldn't take more than 20 minutes to get the basics fleshed
out.)  With my group it's VERY difficult to get the players together
-- MAYBE 1 gaming session a week at the best.  Usually a good 2-3
hours end up wasted on character creation (partially because most of
the people aren't very skilled with GURPS...sigh).
        I hate that, I hate that, I hate that (smile).  I'd love to
just get together one day and have people make characters and play
another day, but it's such hell just to get people together one day
out of the week that I just don't enjoy doing it.  (whine, whine, I
know)
        The alternatives?  Either an extended campaign or (ack!)
pre-made characters.  I rarely like using pre-made characters
although when I've had them shoved in my face I've always enjoyed
playing them.  (For the space game I working on the entire plot
revolves around the different pre-made characters.  I'm sure people
are cringing at this thought, but it works for my group...)
        I like extended campaigns (For us that's anything over 7
sessions or so...) quite a bit.  There's far more character growth
(and I don't mean in skills/stats/munchkinism) and interaction and
allows the GM to slowly build up an interesting plotline and reduce
the "pointless" combats.  It's beautiful to watch a group of players
grow and change during the game.
        (I do happen to enjoy "quick and dirty" one-shots.  We
normally use pre-made characters for this and it doesn't matter much
if characters die since the game doesn't continue.  Some of my
fondest memories of those one-shots, several of which took place in
the "future" of the gaming world...
"Well, you see a woman with a pseudo-dragon as a pet..."
"Wait.  Who's she with?"
"Well, there's a bard, a powerfully-built dwarf, an elf who's
        wearing all black..."
"Ack!  That's our old party!  What're they doing here?"
"Well, she says she's looking for a box..."

        Frightening to meet your "old" party in a new game.  Heheh)

I disagree.  Famiarity with the campaign background, and understanding
of how the campaign world is structured can also foster a desire for
the campaign to continue.  On the part of the referee the reason is
obvious -- less work.  For the players, it can also mean a higher
probability of individual character survival.  If all the rules
change on you every few months, you'll be less likely to know just
what sort of devilish problems are probable...and jumping the wrong
way can sometimes get a character killed.

 NJ>Is my
 NJ>assumption true?  What is the average number of sessions in other 
 NJ>systems that

Locally, not true at all.  The OTHER SUNS campaign has been going on
for 12 years.  Of course, no one scenario has lasted that long (most
scenarios last only one session -- and none have lasted longer than
two dozen sessions).  The players seem satisfied with the campaign
going on and on (and with individual scenarios ending when it is
appropriate for them to end -- in one session or in five or more,
depending upon what seems appropriate at the time).

 NJ>The main reason I can see for long campaigns is the accumulation

Or in the players learning more about the way the referee has
structured his campaign (thereby increasing the survival probabilities
of ALL of their characters).

Possibly the joy of working together in a good team?  There are people
that I worked with years ago that I would dearly love to work with again
on virtually ANY interesting project, simply because they were such
fun to work with.  Can't the characters in a campaign possibly have
similar reasons?

 NJ>The artificial reasons can get a bit

What is so artificial about friendship?  Or mutual respect?  Trust?

If combat is dangerous, then it is a thing to be avoided until all
other reasonable options have been closed off.  I'm forty-two years
old -- and I doubt that I've had to rely on divine intervention to
survive this long, yet I've had a few adventures over the years. And
I've known a few people in the Armed Forces who've had more adventures
in five years than I've had in twenty-five; yet some of these people
are older than I.  They survived (and the characters can too) by a
little bit of forethought, a lot of training, and a bit of good planning.

 NJ>Yet another reason is the reduction in workload for the GM.  
 NJ>Instead of trying

This assumes that the referee is willing to invest additional effort
in another campaign later.  Either that or each campaign will tend
to lack something of the depth of a longer campaign.  Think about it:
if I spend four hours a week working on the background for my campaign,
after two years I've invested 400 hours.  If I just keep building on
what I've done already, each new hour spent can add greater depth to
the campaign.  But if I'm starting all over again, I have to spend a
large amount of time "re-inventing the wheel" for each new campaign.

 NJ>GM's can also
 NJ>get a rest every six months to a year, letting another GM run a 
 NJ>campaign
 NJ>without interrupting one in progress.

Or the referee can switch off with another referee, alternating who
runs when, giving him his "rest" and at the same time not really
forcing an end to his existing campaign.  If I run every other Friday,
say, and you run on the Fridays that I don't run, I'll still be
running 26 games a year (more or less) and I'll have a chance to
play in someone else's game as well...

You'd have the same choice with any character in a continuing

From the viewpoint of a referee: I'll keep running the same

        Oddly enough, I prefer the fixed-length format for fantasy campaigns,
but the open-length format for most other genres.
        I've been running my supers campaign for roughly forever.  It started
out with V&V rev1 rules, then went to Hero, then to SuperWorld, and finally
to my own GURPS Supers variant.  I plan to run it as long as people are
willing to play in it; I've gone through three whole sets of players before
my current group.

        OTOH, my last Fantasy campaign (which never really got off the ground,
alas) had an endgame scenario.  The players were to find and restore the
failing source of magic.  I've probably got too much Ultima on the brain; I
have a hard time envisioning fantasy campaigns without grandiose goals.

Yes it is.  In a previous group I was with, anything that lasted over
30 hours of play had a pretty good chance of lasting for over 400 hours.
That is a lot of character development.

In retrospect, there is a lot to say against always expecting a campaign
to last for a long time.  It discourages the development of new DMs, it
restricts the chances of trying new characters, and it makes "failed"
campaigns more painful.

We tended to start a new campaign only when the old one fell apart or
the DM burned out.  Most DM's of "successful" campaigns could always
come up with something else if the current situation resolved itself.
This limited the chances for a new DM to try their hand.  And when the
chance did come, the new DM was thinking in terms of preparing for an
extended campaign instead of just something that only had to last for
one or two sessions.  That is an awfully big goal for an inexperienced 
DM to try to accomplish. 

When a campaign is "successful" there is little encouragement to try
a new character.  Even when a player is ready to try something else,
there may be pressure from the DM and other players to continue running
a character that has become and important part of the party.  If you try 
something new and quickly find you don't like it there is less reason to 
stick with the character until the end of the game.  People who are
having problems discovering a character they like can be a real pain
in a "successful" campaign.  They keep the party on the level of "finding
out about the new guy" instead of working as team.

Having a campaign "fail" is disappointing.  Some of the campaigns that
"failed" would have made enjoyable games.  Players went into them
expecting to recreate whatever magic there was in the last "successful"
campaign.  If we had settled for just playing a series of games until
whatever it is that happens to makes a campaign happened again there
would have been less disappointment, both on the part of the DM who
ran the "failed" campaign and the players who couldn't stay interested.

Thursday, 30 January 1992 22:18:30 UTC - Neil Robinson:
Our games also suffer from the "it's the game we've always played so let's
keep playing it" problem.  Last summer one of them finally bit the big
green weiner and fell apart.  Yet some players still want to play their
old characters.  It was a semi-munchkin game where almost every character
could do most adventures alone.  Ironically enough, the new game that
replaced it is one of the top three games I've ever played it (even if it
is AD&D).  :-)  I just wish Rob could finish his thesis so we could get
back into it.
Our other extended duration game has its own problems.  New players have a
real problem.  Their character are always coming in at lower level and have
to compete against well-established characters.

To alleviate this I decided to start up a mini-game running before the
regular Monday night event.  It only has three players and is one of my
first attempts at DMing.  If it fails, well it was good experience for me.
As we don't expect it to go far, there is far less pressure on me, and
the players can try something different too.

I'm also starting a RQ campaign with far higher goals than the mini-game.
Hopefully it will be far more ROLE-playing oriented.

Neil

P.S.        Got any good advice for a beginning DM?

I've seldom been in a short-story or one-shot run that didn't leave me
intensely frustrated.  Either the characters never get fully
developed--and then the story can be tied up neatly, but it's not too
interesting--or they do, and then all kinds of interesting possibilities
and loose ends appear which cry out to be followed up on.
I was in a Shadowrun one-session game which we prepared by email for
about 4 weeks in advance, setting up the characters and their
complicated relationships to each other.  It was a great session! but at
the end of it we'd hardly scratched the surface of what those people
were about.  We'd seen them weather one bad situation, and could see
that they had a much worse one ahead of them (fated never to be played
out).  My character was facing a possible choice between his real lover
(if she wasn't dead after all) and an AI image of her--with his
sympathies all too much on the AI's side.

I do agree with another poster that going into a new game expecting it
to equal the glories of past campaigns is a recipie for failure; but I'd
really hate to have to give up on long campaigns all together.  Almost
all of my favorite games have been long, at least a year.  You just
can't get enough complexity, either in characterization or in plot, into
a game which lasts only a few sessions--at least, not without putting
terrible strains on GM and players.

My best campaign so far went for over 2 years, and ran into trouble in
that it got so complicated introducing new players was nearly
impossible; but I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

        I've never fallen into the "this is the campaign we've been
playing in for a long time.  Why stop?" rut with my friends.  At the
very best we play on and off except during the summer when more
people are free.  Regardless, there's usually two to three
"campaigns" running at a time.  We normally switch between them
until one or the other comes to an end or dies.  Of course our
campaigns are normally up to 7 sessions long, so they're fairly
short-lived.
        In our longer term games (like the AD&D one we played all
summer nearly once a week) it was enjoyable.  I enjoyed getting into
character and being familiar with the other players and their
characters.  Unfortunately the game fell apart.  The next year a new
AD&D campaign started up that went on and off for about 2 years.
(Fluctuating anywhere between 4 to 12 players, actually!)  We only
came back to the campaign when the GM had something interesting to
run, so the game never fell into a rut.  And I had a lot of fun
playing a variety of different characters in the campaign because I
rarely could play in the campaign anymore than than one or two
sessions and then be off to school or something.
        It was great to see the campaign grow and change and
intriguing to come into the middle of it as a completely new person
to see how the plot had come along.  So far as I know the game is
still "available" and perhaps it'll be revived this summer again.
All I know is that Kard Arcane needs to die....(smile)

I have run several campaigns,the longest being for D&D which lasted
four years. This took the players from first level upto 30th ish.

From the feedback i found that they enjoyed the campaign greatly.
Some owne there own countries and went to great detail to flesh it out
by designing cities and the like.

I have found that with short one off adventures that the players get
bored and tend to do daft things with their characters since they haven't
got time to fully develop them and flesh them out.
Now we have three new campaigns started, and new one in D&D, one in
Twilight 2000 and one in Cthulu.
At a guess it will be the D&D one which lasts the longest again.

[stuff about a short campaign removed]
What truely is a campaign?
To quote Websters:
Campaign:
1.  A series of military operations with a particular objective.
2.  A series of organized, planned actions for a particular purpose, as for
    electing a canidate.

Redefinition for FRPG could be:

campaign: A series of adventures with a particular goal or objective.

Some people may confuse a long adventure with a short campain.

Also,

Epic Campaign:  1) A seemingly endless series of campaigns.  2) A campaign of
campaigns with a purpose.

This is a matter of perception and DMs handling of his/her universe.  Most of these
types of problems can be blamed on poor DMing!

I have retired many characters in D&D.  I have a 5th level ranger in one game which
may retire soon.

Why keep them alive?  Is this some fallout from the Dragonlance crap?  If characters
do stupid things, why reward them with life? Why can't a campaign run over a 
series of characters or even groups? So let them get killed, it makes for a better story.

> Anyways, I haven't seen any discussion about this topic here before, so the
> response could be interesting.  What do you feel about campaign length and

The first thing one needs to do is seperate adventures from campaigns.
Adventure:  
1.  A bold undertaking, in which HAZARDS are to be encountered and the issue is
    staked on unforseen events.
2.  To take risks
3.  A remarkable occurence in one's personal history.

The second point to make is that not all adventures have to be part of some grand
campaign.  I see so many games that are just one big campaign.  Save the world X
times in a row sort of affairs.

3rd point: some encounters could count as an adventure, other may not.

4 point:  How many encounters should there be in an adventure?  I would say the
minimum is 1. Maximum is hard to say. 

Example:  Outside of town there exists the ruins of an old tower.  The characters
want to adventure there.  There are at least three parts (or potential encounters)
involved.  1) Going to, 2) exploring inside, 3) returning to town.  This counts as
3 potential encounter points for the adventure.  Each encounter point may have 
one or more encounters with NPCs/Monsters.  This is a simple adventure which could
take place over a period a few days for the characters.

Let's say the characters find a massive underground complex.  After a number of
adventures like the one above, the game becomes a campaign based around the ruins.
Perhaps later, some information is discovered inside which could lead the characters
into a series of campaigns.  This would make the game an Epic campaign.

How much time is spent?  Say one week per trip into the dungeon.  Next, say there
are 10-20 of these trips.  That means there are 10 - 20 weeks for this campaign.
How many campaigns to the Epic campaign? Well you get the point.

How does this compare to real world time?  I normally expect the players to get
through an average of 1.5 encounters per hour.  Some are much longer, some can be
much shorter.  The group size can have a big affect on this.  Smaller groups have
battles which take less time, but, they normally take longer to solve major thinking 
problems.   

So if we play 8 hours, I hope to get 8 - 12 encounters out of the way.
So the ruins could be traveled to, explored, and returned from, in one 8 hour gaming
session.  BTW: an encounter could be as simple as asking a local gaurd which way to 
the local mercenary hall.

In my game, characters have a large number of choices of what they can do.  I rarely
have must do adventures.  The players often feel that the MUST do the adventures, but,
they are making a moral choice here (isn't this what role playing is about).  There 
sometimes are campaigns within it, but, the characters normally have to choose to go 
down the campaign path.

I don't know - I generally find that generic 'adventuring' groups are rather 
artificial in most genre's. Finding N people who all like each other enough 
to act as a group in dangerous situations for a long period of time is odd, 
IMHO.

        There are two things to consider here. One is that lots of people 
simply like having their character become more powerful (there's a little 
power gamer in all of us). The other is that the character can get more 
interesting as he goes along: which can be as much from losing wealth and 
skills as gaining them. 
        My character in my current fantasy game recently went through a very 
tough time - and I think he is much more interesting as a result. Character 
depth is not a matter of accumulating things (other than experiences). 


>>

>        The GM should avoid the artificial situations at campaign onset unless

        I find there are many campaign situations are artificial because of 
the conventions of the rpg's. In particular, there is the tendency for PC's 
to accept other PC's for no good reason - "Wait a minute, why are we bringing 
this shaman with us?" "Because Graham is playing him." 
        There are many other tendencies - the tendency to investigate what 
the GM has given you for this session's adventure, etc. 


>>Another reason is that in rpg's where combat is dangerous, it would require a

>        Players should be aclimatized to playing differently in dangerous

        I generally find that most campaigns have the PC's consistently 
going into life-threatening situations. If PC's do not then consistently 
die, then you are lacking a crucial element in this (namely the danger). 
The thought of 'non-dangerous combat' applies to many genre's, but in 
general, I find that GM's are unwilling to kill interesting PC's even 
when it seems the most reasonable result. This is 'artificial'. 
        Also, I find that it reasonable for many of my characters that 
they would tire of this and go into less dangerous pursuits. 

        I especially like short campaigns where the PC's are integral to 
the plot. I ran a short campaign once where the PC's were all siblings 
(and one friend of the family) who were returning home for their father's 
funeral, and discovered some strange events surrounding his death. 
        This allows alot more freedom in the PC's motivations and 
personalities: they don't have to like danger, or all like each other 
enough to continue associating with each other, etc. They can be more 
intimately involved in the plot instead of being drawn into it. (Another 
short campaign was about the PC's fighting a demon which one of them had 
summoned.) 
        Just my $.02 worth.

Monday, 3 February 1992 16:55:51 UTC - Larry Smith:
I've been skipping this thread but a long build let me take a look at a few
and I got caught up a bit.  Most of the argument, at least recently, seems to
center on short campaigns under various GM's vs. long campaigns under one,
with the implicit assumption that the short campaigns are usually different
characters and the long one usually the same characters.
My campaign ran some seven years.  I had a number of games which I would
switch to when I felt I was getting stale, and each one had a number of
long-running campaigns under it.  In Fantasy, for example, I had at least
twenty different parties, with a dozen different people playing the
characters.

To some extent, this helped with the "who showed up this week" problem.  I'd
look for a quorum amongst those present and use the group they best matched.
Anyone who didn't fit got a new character, or they transferred an old character
if one was handly story-line wise.  Also, if I felt stale or thought a given
situation needed thought, it was pretty easy to switch to another group, or
even over to SF for a while.  I was nearly always the GM, my players liked
gaming but didn't much care for GM'ing.

I did two other things that might be of use to someone contemplating a long
running campaign - first, ditch your character generation rules.  I generally
matched the level of the character with that of the player - a very experienced
player does not have a lot of fun starting out all over again with some 1st
level twerp.  Give him enough points to create a character commensurate with
his playing skill, he will reward you by keeping things interesting.  It is
especially useful if the player can retroactively invent a history for the
character, so the new character becomes "real" very shortly.

If you do this it become easier to do the second: don't be afraid to replace
characters.  I've run games that spanned scores of game years, where the
starting characters were semi-mythical beings of legend.  New characters can
be entered as old ones are killed out.  You don't need to preserve the
original starting set.

As for entering such characters, that is where the GM has to prove he really
is better than the players.  I've used countless variations of the old
"encountering another adventurer" gambit.  This is my favorite.  You start
the new character(s) as a party that has been adventuring itself - they may
have some treasure, wounds, whatever - and they join the group at the moment
their two parties meet.

I'm behind a LOT but want to throw in my $0.02 on this....            
The Warhammer FRP campaign my regular group just finished had been going
on with little interruption for the past 4 years or more.  We went through
the entire "Enemy Within" (I think that's the right title) set of 
adventures and when it finished, we finished.  It was great but we came
to a logical (even happy!) conclusion and ended.  After several months
of one-night games, we have started an Ars Magica game which, though the
characters may change regulary, may last for longer than Warhammer.....

I quickly grew tired of the one-nighters and I am REALLY glad to be back on
a regular game.  Running campaigns give the players something to think
about when they are bored and they can't be actively playing.  

I would like to say that role playing a pre-made character is a LOT more
difficult than starting with a character concept and building from there.
This challenge is the only thing that kept me coming back to the one-
nighters.... 

On Ars Magica:  This has to be the coolest thing I have ever seen in FRP.
The "Mythic Europe" setting might actually be an incentive to finish that
Medieval European History course I have an incomplete in.... :)  I have

I hope I didn't give the impression that I favoured single-session games.  I
merely wanted to comment on something I'd encountered (satisfying endings to
short campaigns) and was wondering if other game systems offered the same (I
still haven't received a definite answer).  I feel that the importance of
"accumulation of goodies" as a motivating factor in a game was a common factor
in determining the willingness to end a game after six months or whatever.

Hmm.  Except that it's not always a sure-fire method.  In the first and only
 time I GM'd, I had the evil campaign equivalent of what you described.  The 
 Lord of all Foulness came to these convicts who were due to be executed at
 sunrise, and told them that he would help them escape from prison, if they 
 would then embark on an Anti-Crusade to destroy the prophet whose conversion
 of the entire country had placed them in prison, and was threatening to
 destroy Evil's minions throughout the known world - which would have all but
 eliminated the powers of the evil gods. (No worship, no god.)

I thought it would have been a sweet deal for any evil person who was facing
 certain death at the hands of goody-two-shoes religious fanatics.  Nope.
 The players were giving me crap for about half an hour, until I felt I had to
 send a lightning bolt suizzling across one player's head.

For various reasons, the campaign never really got off the ground.  A lot of
 it was probably my fault.  (For example, it never occurred to me that a 
 bunch of chaotic evils wouldn't necessarily want to co-operate with each
 other.)  Oh, well.

Yes I would like to hear what you have to say.  If my interpretation of your
comment was incorrect, please clarify it.

You stated that "high-level" characters (which I assume are "high-level" due to
the accumulation of something) will not be challenged by a situation that will
wipe out a "low-level" character.  That is not universal, and is definitely not
true in Legacy.

For one thing, "high-level" and "low-level" don't really apply in Legacy.  A
highly-experienced character with high attributes and lots of money and
personal connections would be more capable of succeeding in any given situation
than a character with low attributes, skills, etc, but in five campaigns we
haven't encountered situations that would be easy for one or impossible for the
other.  Maybe Legacy inherently supports this style of gaming (since it's held
true for three GM's).

I would have no qualms about accepting an inexperienced (low skills) character
such as an army private in a group that included a very experienced character
such as an army brigadier general.  The private would have fewer resources
(skills, money, contacts) than the general, but he might even be more
interesting to play than the general.  If I played him for several years and
developed his skills and other resources, he'd have more options in a given
