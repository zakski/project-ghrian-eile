I'd say that your problem was more with the referee than the gaming system per se.  The referee should have taken into account the sort of characters that 
were involved in the game and modified his scenarios accordingly.

This is highly system and campaign dependent.  In my OTHER SUNS campaign,
there might be 1 combat every three to five gaming sessions.  The vast
majority of skill use is in knowledge skills (which, in OTHER SUNS at
least, can improve through experience).

Of course, some of us changed the rules so that knowledge skills (even
in RuneQuest) could all be improved through use.  (Personal theory: one
does not learn so much from "studying for exams" as from using the skill
again and again...in the field, where it's important to YOU that you
succeed.)

This is fine so long as the use of different time scales for combat and
non-combat skills doesn't give anomalous results.  If a system give a skill
roll every ten minutes for non-combat activities, but one per second for
combat skills, there's a 600:1 mismatch in opportunities to use the skills.
RUNEQUEST'S advancement system is such that this makes a big difference: you
have to use the skill *successfully* to advance, so the number of trials is
important.
