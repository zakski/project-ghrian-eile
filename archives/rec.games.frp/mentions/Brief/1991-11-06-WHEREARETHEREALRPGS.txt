Just kind of curious, but does anyone on this newsgroup play real frps, where
you can have real battles, such as Warhammer, or Battletech?  If you play these
games, you can spend hours on end in your basement playing with little metal

These are real rpgs? Real _Role-playing_ games?!? To misquote Douglas Adams,
"I see. This is obviously some strange new definition of the word `role-
playing' of which I was previously unaware." I'm not slamming blood 'n'
guts games, but there's more to role-playing than combat. Okay, WARHAMMER is
a role-playing game if played properly, but by lumping it with BATTLETECH,
you seem to not be playing it as a role-playing game. MECHWARRIOR is a role-
playing game, but if all you want to do is fight, why bother buying MECHWAR-
RIOR? There's a rec.games.wargames or somesuch if you want to discuss war-
games with like-minded souls. Rec.arts.frp isn't the place to do so.

     This probably has already been said before, but most of those games
are dealt with under rec.games.board, probably for lack of a better home.
     HOWEVER, some of us up here wonder if anyone plays Warhammer FRP --
normal AD&D is just too tame for these frigid North Dakota nights -- and
we'll just comment on the paucity of posts on the game as unusually low
     So, we'll start the ball rolling. What do WFRPers think of the new,
"optional" armor breaking rules in the Companion released earlier this year?
Is anybody else tired of Games Workshop only using Chaos as baddies in their
adventures? What's the most damage any poor monster has had to suffer from
a player's HTH attack (or visa-vee)? And what's the nastiest creature you've
legitimately rolled up with Realm of Chaos?

Mostly I play Other Suns, variants of same hashed with Call of Cthulhu,
sometimes Champions, and we're starting up a Cyberpunk campaign, centered

Nah, but you have to worry about congress trying to deem the lead minatures a
danger to young children and legistate them out of business.  One master or
another.

As for them being 'real frps' I have other opinions (but that's what Usenet
is all about.)  I haven't seem much discussion about them here and have
heard that BattleTech is more found in rec.games.board (not, not r.g.bored)
than here.  Mayhaps 40K & Warhammer Fantasy Battles too.  WH Fantasy
Roleplay was a topic here a few months ago, but interest seems to have 
  a) died down or
  b) moved to e-mail.

Picks up keyboard, steps up on box:

        Ahem!  Excuse me, but unless you really want to push it, and buy extensions
galore for a system that wasn't designed for it, Battletech is not a FRPG.
It is a battle simulation game (and a very fun one at that).  There are
four letters in FRPG and they stand for words: Fantasy, Role Playing,and
Game.  It would be very difficult (not to mention boring) to remove religion
from Fantasy, so these sorts of things come up.  I have never enjoyed role
playing games where all of the emphasis was on combat.  To each her own.
(In other words, don't post something with a phrase like "real frps" in it
unless you want the same in return.)

Well, this soap box is starting to make ominous creaking sounds and I think
someone from House Davion is knocking on the door, so...

Although I am loathe to get up on my own soapbox, you leave me no choice.
DESPITE the poor first effort from FASA in terms of an ACTUAL roleplaying 
system to accompany Btech, almost everyone I now who play Btech, has a least
to some extent, created and played personal characters, often real roleplaying
rather than roll-playing.  FASA created a marvelously rich background for the
game, spitting out more information on their worlds, things such as clothing, 
culture, lifestyles etc than most individual role playing systems.  Furthermore
with the introduction of Mechwarrior II, a much improved sytem, (even if it
was cloned directly from Shadowrun...) you will see more 'official' roleplaying.

Well there is a LOT of differences 'tween Shadowrun and MW-II,
Creating a character in either system is very "similer" because both systems
use a "priority" point system. But other then that they games differ
in many ways.
Differences.. (Note i've only played shadow run about 4 times..)

1) Damage - Both games use Killing/Bruise, but SW weapons inflict damage
            in a Radicially different way.. (Not better/worse, just different)
3) Skills - Using skills in MW-II is basicially a "roll 2D6 vs ya skill"
            Shadow run skill system has me totally confused... 
            (Of course i Role-played and let the GM figger out the Mechanics)
4) Weapons - The weapon damage from MW-I has NOT changed.
             Weapons in SW, (Again i just played, and rolled dice..)


Over all:

SR: is more complecated then MW-II, and i hear there are some major 
    bugs in the rules, (Or Lack of examples)


MW-II: Simple system. LOTS of examples. Few little Bugs..
       the major thing in MW is remembering to roll 3 or 2 dice...
       (We call them a Super-Roll, and a Normal-Roll)
              
Well C-ya.

Okay, the original poster was refering to Battletech itself as a role-playing
game.  The post ammounted to someone saying that real rpg'ing meant playing
with metal figures in the basement, and that religion, etc. shouldn't be a
concern.  This is what I was replying to.  My comments re Battletech were
merely intended to point out how narrow this person's view was (as I had hoped
my parentheses would make clear).  I have no doubt that Mechwarrior II is a
good rpg system, though I haven't really checked it out myself.  The ammount
of FASA stuff that I see on the shelves when I go to the comic store would
certainly attest to this.  I am sure that the original intention of this
person's post was to complain about the ongoing Church vs RPG threads, but
it was done in a rather antagonistic way.  If you are reading this, consider
that a kill file may achieve what you want better than sarcasm.  (I hope that
didn't sound as obnoxious as it probably did. :*) )Anyway, thank you,
and others, for pointing out some of the strengths of Mechwarrior II.  If I
ever have time to revive my lance, I will cetainly consider exploring this
further.

Just got MWII this weekend, and been busy converting Taylor's Tigers to it.
Nice system - easy to generate characters. Actually, helped me to sort out a
couple of the characters background while doing the redesign as well.
I'm thinking of coming up with a few more background skill packages, since we
had to bend the rules a bit to get a couple of characters to work the way the
needed.

In the world of Battletech,
In the future expansion of the universe,

Comes a new force to the planet.

It comes down to 2 mechs, a Victor and a Zeus.

I am piloting the Zeus, and we are playing in the city.

My question resolves as such...

I knocked down the Victor, and unloaded my weapons,
next I pushed the front of her mech (head first) into
a heavy building.  How much damage should she take?

Also, the referee said that a kick or punch to a specific location
gets the bonus of a -4 to the attack.  (At the time, I was on my back
with my head facing the Victor)?

Depends. If it's a lightly contructed brick building, not a lot, probably none.
If it's reinforced and armoured to the hilt, a few (note I said "few") points.
If there isn't a definitive answer in the rules, I gues you'll have to invent
one. It shouldn't do more damage than a puch at maximum, I feel.

Er - so? Sounds like a local rules variation to me.

          Hmmmm...can you push whilst lying down?

  Just use the good old fashioned rules governing walking through a building.
Because the individual in question isn't doing this voluntarily, you might
throw in a minus or two for the piloting test, but not much more.  I think the
falling damage is a little worse that the damage from the building.  I mean,
if you push an 80 ton thing over, the damage from it hitting the ground is
gonna be pretty heavy.  That office building it crumples on the way down won't
do much to add to the damage...
  To be specific, if the piloting skill roll for damage from entering a building
fails (there's a chart you can look at) the mech entering the building takes
the remaining structural points of the building divided by ten, rounded down.
  I belive that a heavy building (undamaged) has 90 points, which gives 9
points of damage in groups of 5.  Assuming the skill roll fails.  
  It's also possible that the individual might fall, so you can add falling
damage to all this.

  Then, if the building has been previously damaged, you have the excessive
joy of rolling for possible basements.  A double story basement can really
screw things up for them...


>> Also, the referee said that a kick or punch to a specific location
>> gets the bonus of a -4 to the attack.  (At the time, I was on my back
>> with my head facing the Victor)?
>Er - so? Sounds like a local rules variation to me.
  Yeah, looks like that to me too.  From what I remember, you'd have a -2 for
the person being on the ground, but there's something like +4 for aiming at a
specific location (except the head...that's special)  Now if you happen to be
unconscious or shut down, there's a -4 to hit, which cancels the +4 and gives a
total of -2.  Hmmm...yeah, must be a house rule.
  Unless of course the person is a kick-ass pilot (we modify physical attacks
by piloting where I play)  Then the -4 might be possble...
  You might modify by gunnery though...
