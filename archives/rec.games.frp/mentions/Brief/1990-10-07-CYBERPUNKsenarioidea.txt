Why not consider occasionally what your characters do when they aren't out fighting the system?  What sort of party could you throw with the kind of tech 
available in a cyberpunk mileau?  What's the equivalent of going backpacking?  A day at the beach?

In the Other Suns campaign I'm involved in, we occasionally vary things by having the characters go on shore leave and get into interesting situations (and 
no, they don't always involve trouble with the SPs.)  Like the time a group went out hunting.  While most carried rifles, my own character brought a camera to 
do her hunting with, while another (a H'rel - a race of felinoids with an interesting sense of humor) decided to bring along a batch of pies.  Off in the 
distance, an NPC hunter made the "large flesh colored squirrel.  A deer in a red hunting jacket" mistake and opened fire on the H'rel.  The NPC missed.  The
H'rel didn't - caught him full in front with a cream pie.  My character filmed all of this...

A couple of other characters spent all of their time "hunting" each other, and got married a couple of game sessions later!
