Unfortunately, even if an attempt is made to test simulations, the real
world data is frequently inadequate or too scattered to give any
hope of a good simulation fit REGARDLESS of what the designer
does.  I TRIED to get decent information on gunshot wounds and
stopping power when I designed OTHER SUNS.  And found out, much
to my dismay, that NO ONE agreed (more powder has been burned
since on this subject than I care to think about).

Discouraging, isn't it?  But, as the "longbow" and "fencing"
discussions show, just because everybody has an opinion doesn't mean
that they know what they're talking about.

One of the things I look for in a game is adherence to basic
principles: bigger guns do more damage than littler guns, for
instance.  Skinny high-velocity slugs penetrate better than fat
low-velocity slugs (even though the fat low-velocity slugs will rip
you up more).  This is embodied in the Army's abandonment of .38
pistols in favor of .45 ACP after finding the .38's ineffective in
the Philippines at the turn of the century, and the eagerness of some
of our allies to work out deals with American units so they could get
rid of their 9 mm pistols in favor of .45's.  But the .45 is useless
against any kind of bulletproof armor, while the 9 mm can sometimes
get through.

Most game systems can't handle this.  CYBERPUNK can't represent a .45
as having more stopping power than 9 mm without also giving it
greater armor penetration.  In a system where armor is so important,
this is an awfully weak implementation (but typical of unmodified
"armor absorbs damage" systems). The problem becomes comical when you
consider soft-nose rifle ammunition (massive damage, minimum
penetration) vs. fully jacketed ammunition (minimum damage, maximum
penetration) for the same weapon.

What model you use depends on what you think is important.  My last
campaign was set in 1908, when there was no effective armor against
firearms.  My mechanics ignored armor entirely.  No problem.

If the interactions between weapons and armor are important to the
campaign, you have to be more careful.  CYBERPUNK should have
separated the concepts of "tissue damage" and "armor penetration."

Perhaps the easiest way around the problem is to have secret (or at
least unpublished) mechanics.  When it comes right down to it, it's
hard to guess the underlying details of the mechanics from even a
large number of combats.  If the players can't see the mechanics, and
don't keep careful records of the results of each shot, they can't
see the difference between two vaguely similar weapons.
