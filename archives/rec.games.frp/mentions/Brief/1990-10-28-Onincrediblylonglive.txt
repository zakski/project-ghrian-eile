Interestingly enough, in the local Other Suns campaign Nicolai is running, 
a drug which extends Altani lifespans drastically (heck - they've a 
potential of 800 years as it STANDS) is seriously illegal for just that

so in species who DON'T limit anti-agathics, and are that afraid of losing 
ground.
