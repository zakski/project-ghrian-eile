I think you nailed it with personal style. Every GM is different and what
matters is what your player enjoy. Personally I agree that the player make
their own plots rather than following your story but interfere with the random
elements anytime I like when I think the players will enjoy it. Eg. getting a
bit stale so I chuck some "edge" in. Low on morale so toss an easy problem in.
However I think that even with this style, the creativity element is very high
(higher than fixed plots in fact). You have to keep the world moving around the
players in the manner which is consistant with both the tiny parts the players
influence and in time with larger events outside their control. Without the
larger scale of events, the world has little depth. Since you arent forcing
players along any route, you have to create the areas they choose to move in
and all the NPC's as they happen. Plotting GM's hate the unexpected if they
cant improvise fast and consistantly.

To Steve Benz:
One quibble, Steve:
As a person who prepares resume's for a good part of their living, 
I note you have a false premise built into part of your argument. 
 I see AT LEAST as many people with two BA or BS degrees cross my 
desk as those with a Masters of any sort.
I would suspect that the tendency toward greater specialization has 
far more to do with the demands of modern society than any natural 
tendency of the human race.
On the other hand, your talent argument is good.  The game Aftermath 
used to have just that.  In addition to your stats, you had talents: 
Communicative, Combatitve, Esthetic, Mechanical, Scientific, Natural 
and Charismatic.  Part of the skill base was constructed from these 
talents, and they were the biggest influence on your progression.

There are two possible reasons that I can think of:

1) Random tables can be a good "brain spark generator";  a decent GM can
   take the random event and make it into something interesting.  For
   example,  Midkemia Press's "Cities",  now sold as Avalon Hill's
   "RuneQuest Cities",  contains huge tables of random events with not
   merely participants but also motivations.  A GM could then take this
   and turn it into an interesting event.

   As a sideline,  such an item might be useful before gaming starts as
   an idea seed for a GM to create new adventures.

2) Your gaming philosophy is obvious from your phrase "what you're trying
   to achieve in an adventure..."  As a GM,  your style tends towards the
   story-telling variety,  where you have ideas of what's going to happen
   and your players have ideas and you merge these all to create an epic
   tale.  But a lot of GMs prefer a more "clockwork diety" style,  where
   they create a world for the players' characters to explore,  with few
   or no preconceptions of what will happen.  In such a world,  randomness
   is almost necessary;  the complexities of human interaction result in
   what seems random to all but the most thorough investigations.  For
   the "clockwork diety" GM,  therefore,  the random encounter is pretty
   much a necessity,  unless he/she can somehow characterize the actions
   of thousands of individuals.

   A potential problem with the non-"clockwork" style is that often the
   characters' actions are affected by the foibles of the GM.  If the
   players know that adventures will come to the characters,  or that the
   GM is basically guiding the characters along,  it may affect their
   playing style.  It can require a conscious effort by the GM to keep
   from falling into this trap.

for certain games, this is worthwhile, and to me preferable. however there are
some games (or specifically _systems_) where this is difficult to say the
least.  in call of Cthulhu, for example, it is tough to follow a "random string
of events" because of the experience mechanics. if the investigators move from
random event to random event, when is an "adventure"over, allowing them to
clear their skill checks?

 for other games (such as gamma world, TWERPS, *d&d, and other combat oriented
games) the randomness idea is more easily implemented, and likely more enjoyed
by all.

This is only a problem in modern (18th century and onward).  During

It is not the *system's* fault if the *player* has a poor idea of
character conception.  Min-maxing is usually a symptom of a player
wishing to optimize his character for one reason: combat.  I, for one,
de-emphasize combat in my games and combat monsters frequently find
themselves wishing that they had diversified somewhat...

Hrmm...Let's pretend that I'm a 1st Sgt with combat experience.
You're a 2nd Lt. right out of West Point.  Who has the higher 'level'?

Another example: I'm a Major with a PhD in some field.  You're the
General in charge of the project I'm, working on.  How do these
'levels' relate?

Rank and ability have little to do with each other in the so-called
"real" world.

>Levels are everywhere, in social circles, sports, politics... everywhere.
>We just have different names for them.  With increased skill comes

But in social circles (to pull apart another example), ability has less to
do with the 'level' than the person's lifestyle and contacts.  If I'm
a lowly newspaper reporter with years of experience covering the
nation, and I'm invited to some major social function.  I would be
'inferior' to some kid from a family with 'old money'.  But I would
have 'earned' more experience.

And what if I'm a mercenary fighter with 10 years of experience under
my belt and Lord Justin was comfirmed in his rank last month.  I will
probably be a much better fighter, but the *society* demmands that I
obey Lord Justin.  Not his experience level.

But D&D levels automatically include the increase in social standing
that is not automatic (or in some cases, wanted) in real life.
'Skill points' only reflect the character's abilities.  His
relationship with the rest of the world is independant of that (as you
have stated.)  This factor is handled by other game mechanics...

Heh...I have played many characters for whom social advancement is not
possible, or desired (or both), but for whom skill improvement is the
determining factor in his outlook on life.

I think you are misinterpereting the basis on which skill points are
awarded.  The vast majority of skill points are awarded for *playing
in character*.  Not how well the character did in the adventure
(though it is a factor), nor how well he used his skills (though it is
another factor).  In fact, more points are awarded for proper
role-playing if it *endangered* the mission.

I do not wish to enter into an argument about the 'rightness' of this
particular method, but character points are a measure of a character's
'raw' ability.  The relationships with the rest of the world are
handled by other game mechanics and the GM.

I personally ask my players to clear all skill point expenditures with
me.  If I feel that a certain gained skill is not appropriate
considering the activities undertaken during the previous adventure, I
will say so and suggest alternatives or ask them to justify the
requested gain in skill.  It takes only a few minutes per character,
and it works well.

And he's got a point of sorts.  But I still disagree.  Sure, it's a neat 
little intellectual exercise to try to fit in a random event in an otherwise
planned adventure.  But no table is going to constantly throw out events
which can be fit in, and what do you do when the table gives you a result
which you don't like?  I suspect you just throw it out and role again.

If that is the case, why not just make up a list of good potential encounters
appropriate to the region, the time and the situation, and then pick from
them as the mood takes you and as fits the actions of the PCs best?  Pulling
adventures at choice from a pool of possibilities seems like a much better
way to handle such things if you want a certain amount of surprise and 
variety, because it avoids the possible flukes and failures inherent in any
truly random system.

  I've got to admit, this has me a bit puzzled. On occasion I've thought that it
would make for an interesting game, where the players played themselves. But there
are problems with this though. For instance a part of most (if not all) games
involves some form of combat, what do you do in these situations? Do they occur ?
If I was going to play myself in a game setting, I suspect that I would hide in the
nearest Safe till the shooting/Blasting/chopping/whatever had finished (Then I'd
count to 100 and exit said Safe).
  If you play yourself, do you play your skills that you possess, or do your 
'characters' (Bad term in this case) have different skills?
  Does you playing yourself (for ethical reasons) mean you react to the other
players in different ways than you would expect should be the case (Do you treat them
as themselves or as their characters?)
  Do you think it detracts from your pleasure of playing the game

To change the example to something I'm more familiar with, consider
a young man emerging from college with Math-19 or whatever, woefully
deficient in certain other skills and knowledge.  The first thing
this young man finds out is that he is *not* equipped to function
optimally, and begins spending "experience points" on various other
things.  The mathematical skill is not neglected, and the man still
has much of the outlook of a mathematician, but the character has
diversified.

We can apply that to a character with Sword-19.  She has been training
all her life to be a good swordswoman, and she has achieved it.  Now
she goes out and tries to apply the sword to general situations.  She
finds that being good with the sword is extremely useful in some
situations, irrelevant in many, and positively dangerous in a few.
She starts picking up other skills, partly because her ability with
a sword is already good enough for most purposes, partly because
acquiring further sword skill is getting difficult (well modelled in
GURPS, less so in Hero), and partly because she really needs the
diversification to get along.

She will retain her basic philosophy that the sword is the answer,
what's the question?  She will, to a large extent, see other skills
as less direct ways of using a sword, or getting a sword into play,
perhaps even as alternatives to a sword in some circumstances.  She
will be happy when all the social and technical problems are cleared
away and it's "This is my sword; what weapon do you choose to die
with?" time.  But she will diversify, and she will become much
more competent at situations not requiring mayhem.

     Yup.  I thought so.  You're character-oriented when it comes to
your playing style.  I'm environment-oriented.  You like to work on your
character and create a different and new person, and your game universe
is part of what creates and changes your character, yes?  I just like
to explore the universe, and I view my character as just my access to
the environment, and as such needing only minimal work at generation.

     Ah, but the setting is what I'm interested in.  That's why I'd be
there in the first place.  I'm sorry that you'd feel that way, since
even if I did go to the trouble to create a role and personality for my
character, I wouldn't use it, since I'm *rotten* at role-playing--I
can't imagine being anything other than myself, so that's how I play my
character.

     Also, I don't view a game as "work" (which I define as "anything I
don't want [or like] to do")--it's "play."  My players and I aren't
there to "create" anything, or (heaven forbid) *work*.  We just want to
have a good time.  Heck, when we get together for a game session (which
happens to be whenever we're all free at the same time--too seldom), we
spend more time talking, joking, munching, and drinking Coke (tm) than
we do playing the game.

     I think that you're far more serious about gaming than I am.

Depends - I'd hate to have to go back to keeping my character sheets on
pieces of paper that got progressively harder to read as the character
improved, or had to be recopied all the time (and could be relatively
easily lost.)  Or drawing all maps by hand.  Or typing, retyping, and
retyping house rules.  Or doing Champions characters without a spread-
sheet.  (Or computing subsidiary stats for Other Suns, Albedo, and other
games along those lines by hand and maybe making a mathematical goof.)

I agree that I wouldn't want a computer to do my GMing for me, but the
things are pretty useful otherwise...

     Certainly they do.  Fairly frequently, too.  I have no problems
with combat in the game.  I guess I have an aggressive personality, so
when combat situations come up, I grab my favorite weapon and wade right
in.  Not a problem.  :-)  I've had training with most types of weapons

     Oh, I generate a character for each scenario (don't do many
campaigns), different stats, different skills (I prefer skill-based
systems), etc., each time.  I just use my own personality to "animate"
the character.  I just react to an event as if it was happening to me,
and use my generated character as an interface into the game system.
Sure, I've had characters that have had skills that I don't personally
possess (not as many as you might think--I enjoy learning new things).

     I treat them as their characters in the game, and as themselves
over by the munchie table.  :-)  I consider the other player characters
to be part of the game environment, so I have no problem with reacting
to "character personas" as opposed to "player personas."

     Actually, I think it adds to my enjoyment of the game, since I
don't have to worry about things like "how would my character react

well, *me*.  It makes game life a *lot* easier...  ;-)

I'd say that it tells us a lot more about what the market wants than
that the first in dominates.  There were some very good points to
the original D&D:

   (1) it took less than five minutes to roll up a character
       (compare this with a first time roll-up time of 50-60
       minutes for RQ III, 40-50 minutes for OTHER SUNS, or
       40 HOURS for C&S -- in the case of a well aspected Scorpio
       Mage who happened to have 10 years of previous experience
       to account for)

   (2) the milieu was familiar to most of the players (sword and
       sorcery/dungeon crawl)

   (3) there were lots of things to take adolescent angst out on
       (read:  there were LOTS of interesting monsters to kill).

Hack and slash still dominates the business.  It's fun, it's easy
and everybody likes it.

There is still a market for well thought out games where the
emphasis is OTHER than "what new monster can I kill?" but it is
a much smaller market.

I'm not sure I agree with this assessment.  I do way more GMing than I do
playing, so I rarely get to actually create or play a character, but I put 
enormous amounts of work into creating an environment...in a sense, into
role-playing a really well developed world.  If you like to tour a good
environment, you must realize that creating that environment and getting it
across to players effectively requires a great deal of creativity and 
creation of personality -- role-playing.  That's mostly what I do.

hmmm...I don't see gaming as work either, though doing it well requires some
effort.  Creativity can be fun...a lot more fun than just socializing with
the game as an excuse.  As I see it the rewards you get out of gaming are
to some degree proportional to the effort and thought you put into it, as is
the case with almost any activity.

We do take role-playing seriously, but we also have a good time.  I don't think
they are mutually exclusive.

To David Nalle:
There are a couple of answers to this.
First, while I will not try to deny a facility you claim you have 
without playing with you, it is my opinion that any GM who does it 
entirely off the top of their head gets in a rut.  A creatively 
interpeted random roll is an antidote for that.
Secondly, I try for a naturalistic effect in my campaign.  I don't 
WANT everything to have "significance".  That's a disease of the 
storytelling GM.  Some of what happens to people are just supposed 
to be the crosscurrents of the world, so not every encounter is viewed 
as Of Importance.

My housemate (the GM of the Jayhawk stories) gets a *lot* of use out
of various kinds of randomization; he finds that the random result
provides a prod for his creativity, and is easier to work with than
making something up 100% from scratch.  He ran one of the scariest
spirit journeys I have ever seen starting from what I considered the
completely worthless random tables in the Shadowrun Grimoire.  So
for some GMs at least randomization can be an aid to creativity,
rather than a barrier.

My own use for it is more pragmatic.  If I do everything by improvisation 
or preparation, without any random factor, it is too easy for me to make
*all* the encounters part of the adventure theme, avoid niggling
annoyances altogether, and in general run something that feels contrived.
A little randomization helps me produce the illusion of a real world
in which *not* everything is relevant to the adventure at hand.

Dave,

One of the articles I want to write is on this topic.  In our game, our PCs
had left the capitol while the Council was debating War or Peace for the
coming campaigning season.  (This in playertime was over a year ago, it is
_NOT_ desert-storm commentary.)  We the GMs had not decided whether council
would go for it or not.

Just south of the Duchy the party was headed for, my random encounter
table (which uses exponential decay models) genated an encounter with
a ducal war-leader and VERY large retinue on the road.  When I
informed my co-gm (my wife the author, who is co-gm for plot; I'm
co-gm for mechanics & trivia), she realised THIS MEANS WAR.  

WAR was a decision we could have made rationally, or could have assigned
probabilities to -- but the encounter dice said that they met their
liege-lord's lord (he was the mostly likely Dux to encounter on the road
there), and it was the likeliest explanation given the encounter with
such a large troupe headed in the direction of civilization.  (Had the 
hoarde been headed to the boonies, we'd say they were going hunting by
default.)

We *do* generate lists of pre-plotted encounters.  These occur typically
at the first opportunity, or on next op. on which I dice a % --
and can be triggered by meeting someone "similar" on the random table.

I also roll the random encounter list *in advance* so that my co-gm can be
pre-plotting (or discarding) the encounters before they happen.

Having a novelist to handle NPCs and Plot twists is real handy!

        I have an idea for a stand-alone DM-Assistant program. I would
envision as more of a reference type program with pull down menus. Mostly
you would have the map of wherever your characters are on the screen.(perhaps
it might have a design feature also or import from some kind of CAD program)
        So your characters are somewhere, lets say its a medium sized medieval
city. On your screen is the map of the whole city. Your players decide to
go to the Market Square. Click (I like mice) on the Market Square and you
get a detail map. Now say they need to go do Joe's armor shop, click on Joe's
Armor shop and you get a detail map of that and a window with a short 
description of Joe and his armor shop etc. At the bottom of the text window are
buttons with options for more info. Player wants to buy a sword, click on
button marked *INVENTORY*. List of weapons and prices etc.
        You get the idea. Not too complex and a good way to keep records
on your world. Now lets expand this idea further. Player decides to be a 
bastard and attack Joe. Call up info on Joe. Oh no! You didn't do stats for
Joe,(why would you, you wouldn't expect this most of the time). So go to
your pull down menu's and select ROGUES GALLERY. We'll say that Joe is a
fighter and just to be nasty we'll say he's 5th level. We select FIGHTER and
5th LEVEL from the menu's and we see that we have 2 to choose from. We pick
one, change his AC(Joe isn't wearing armor) and permanently make that Joe.
        Now we fight. Joe picks up a Double-Hand Sword from behind the 
counter and goes at it. The DM pulls down the DICE menu and creates a dice
roll window, selects d20 and rolls. Joe misses. The players rolls his analog
random number generators and scores a critical. The DM pulls down the TABLES
menu and calls up his very own crit table. Changes the dice window to d100
and rolls for it. The Player cut Joe's head off!! The player steals Joe's
gold and rushes out the door. The DM pulls down the MONSTERS menu, selects
WANDERING, selects City Guard and gets the stat's on the patrol that just
witnessed this horrible robbery....
        This would be best with a Laptop/Portable. What do you think?

Re: GMing style.  I have random event (vs encounter) tables that I use before
game play.  If I don't like the result, nor does it give me an idea, then I
reroll.  Once I've rolled or thought of (based on the roll) an event, whether
encounter or weather or natural occurrence (i.e. falling rock), then I
create it and write it down.  This saves time during play and still gives
the effect of happenstance.
I find that I don't do this often if I have a plot line already in mind, but
it helps sometimes when not quite all the players show up (and they all need

[Comments about trend toward classless systems that use points

In my experience the class system wins over point systems with new
players.  A "fighter" or "magic user" gives a lot more concept
to beginning players rather than doing the whole thing from scratch.

I've noticed this trend myself and first thought this was a good thing.
I think its in response to the larger number of people who are now
rpg "literate" and know what they want to put into a character (or is
that put themselves into? see below.) and don't want to be constrained
by what someone else thought of as a cohesive set of skills.

RQIII tends to overdue it: a time consuming process that goes cradle to
grave in GREAT detail if you want it to.  So does GURPS: how many mental
problems do you want?

Why is it people want benfits/penalties for parts of their characters?
Why this emphasis on point (i.e. "cash") flow?

Probably the most interesting game I've seen is TWERPS (Reindeer Games--
I kid you not.  somewhere in Wisconsin I think), the ultimate in 
minimalist role playing.  You get one attribute: Strength and when you
need to roll a skill test you roll against Strength.

Saturday, 26 January 1991 07:26:10 UTC - David Nalle:
Randomness:
The kind of randomness you (Bill Ricker) are talking about in the example
which you posted is something different.

It is randomness within a VERY strictly defined set of limitations.  It's not
a random question whether the lord will be encountered during the adventure,
merely at what point he will show up by 'coincidence'.  That's very different.
All you're doing is allowing your PCs a certain lack of definition in the 
amount of time that they will engage in other activities before a planned
action is initiated.

That's a pretty limited use of random factors.  In the same situation I still
would have avoided randomness.  I would probably have set a timetable for 
the lord, and when his itinerary intersected that of the player the event
would have happened.  I suppose in that case the random factor would have been
what the players chose to do and how long it took in game time.  But to me
it still seems different.

Interesting though...thought provoking.  Certainly a good element to put in
some sort of article.

When my brain finally burns out I may resort to your cure.  But for now
I find that it is a remarkably resilient organ and easily capable of

Perhaps you're planning your adventures too much?  Or at least too much for
some people's tastes.  It is very easy to fall into the trap of having an
adventure that leads the players around by the nose,  which can lead to
player boredom.

>But no table is going to constantly throw out events
>which can be fit in, and what do you do when the table gives you a result
>which you don't like?

If your table is giving events that don't fit the situation,  either the
table is faulty or you're using it in an incorrect situation.  Scratch the
entry off the list or use a different table if you have one.

Can you give a good example of an event that "wouldn't fit?"

If you have to eliminate events because they don't fit your plans,  perhaps
your plans are too set.  If your plans are too pre-set,  there's no sense
of accomplishment if the players succeed.  For success to be fulfilling,
there has to be a chance of failure.

>If that is the case, why not just make up a list of good potential encounters
>appropriate to the region, the time and the situation, and then pick from

Why not randomly select from those pregenerated ones?  It's far too easy to
fall into a rut.

How do you handle combat?  Do you roll randomly for your combat manuevers,
or do you decide as GM what happens?

So, you *do* create a character and role-play afterall.
You just don't think you do, because the characters you play are
very similar in temperament/skills/personality/abilities to the
"real" you.  Actually, I think this is fairly common.
However, most people who do this at least give their characters
a name (other than their real name).

There are certainly different levels of "role-play", and I think
many people are most comfortable playing characters with beliefs and
personalities similar to their own.  On the other hand, some people
like the challenge of playing roles drastically different from
their "real" persona.

But one *could* easily make simple and reasonably competent prototypes
with pre-defined advancement paths that simulate classes despite using
a point-based system.  (Whether the rules provide for that or not is
another question.)  Then as the player (not the character,  note) gains
experience,  they can gradually deviate from these prototypes.

Am I missing something?  RQ does have a number of bonuses to calculate,
but their basic experience system is very simple and pretty much like
the above,  although the age roll is far too significant.  (Note:  I
am not impressed by RQ's character generation system:  although the
basic idea is reasonably good,  the execution is not.)

>Why is it people want [benefits]/penalties for parts of their characters?

For the same reason that Gygax always invoked the power of the great
god Play Balance.  It also *supposedly* makes it easier to design adventures
for the strength of the characters based on their point values.

        Do you consider encounters that make the world a real place (ie.
not centered around the pcs and whatever plots they've cooked up) of
value, even if they are of no potential interest to the characters?

I agree.  I think that Professions (in Rolemaster to a large extent, and
also in HarnMaster, to name two examples) can be a very effective
`comprimise' solution.
Some people consider RoleMaster to be a class-based system because of the
Professions, but they are missing something central, I think.  Again, in
HarnMaster, one's profession is very important.  HarnMaster is probably not
good for beginning GMs, but would be fine for beginning players, I think.
RoleMaster is only good for beginners, I suspect, with a GM who likes to
keep the mechanics in the background, but the Profession/Class stuff is a
big help.

This works much better in some settings than in others.  In the West today,
one's job rarely has such a strong bearing on one's skills as it did to
Mediaevel people in a feudal environment, where you _couldn't_ learn a
trade without joining the guild.  No night schools!

The A3 game system (my own, unpublished) has no attributes and no mechanism
at all.  The only way it could be more minimalist is if it had no players or
name :-)  Actually there _is_ a character generation system, although dice
are not involved.  You describe the character and fill in a week's timetable.

I had a player like this once.  She'd ask, when visiting a peasant family
with twelve children, `what are their names?'.
I would carefully look in my binder, and then read out the next 12 names
from the random name sheet...

Once she had run a few games herself, she no longer expected the GM to have
mapped out _every_ detail in advance.

My worlds are fixed in that details don't change, as far as I can help.
But they are created on demand, not beforehand.  What's the difference?

     I couldn't agree more.  That's one of the reasons that I don't
play (or ref) in fantasy settings (besides the fact that I don't much

exclusively in fantasy-based games, since she likes to use her SCA

     Yes, it *is* limiting, but I don't have any gripes about that,
since I'd be working under the same limits (more or less) anyway, just
due to my personal tastes.  My personality works for my character
without any problems, since I stick to environments that I *like*, so
I just seem to automatically fit in well enough (when I play, that is,
which isn't really that often--I ref *much* more frequently).

     One thing that I should mention now (and probably should have done
so much sooner) is that this works for *me*.  I'm not advocating it as
the way things should be done.  I have a couple of players in my group
who spend literally weeks on developing each of their characters before
they get anywhere near the game.  One character takes up pages of
closely-printed text.  We still get along fine, though.  :-)

one of the important things you have to do if you've got any kind of world at 
all is to make sure that the players are aware that it is there and understand
that they are part of a larger whole.

and I do use encounters to do this, and I also use entire adventures to bring
out aspects of the world as part of the general action.  But doing that in no
way requires randomness, and by choosing what background type encounters I use
I can introduce that background in the most creative and constructive ways
possible.

To which I would have to respond that as a player, if a GM had to constantly
refer to notes over basic aspects of the situation and game world I would
worry about his capacities as a GM and his familiarity with the material.

It's something I'd only expect to see in a very novice GM.

The difference is that GMs sometimes get as attached to particular aspects of
their campaign as players get with their characters.  This can lead to GMs 
changing things to save a favorite "detail".  As players have to sometimes "eat"
the death of a character, so too should the GM "eat" the death of one of those
"details".  The GM should pre-plan as much as possible because that is the only
control over arbitrariness most GMs have.

   To change the example to something I'm more familiar with, consider
   a young man emerging from college with Math-19 or whatever, woefully
   deficient in certain other skills and knowledge.  The first thing
   this young man finds out is that he is *not* equipped to function
   optimally, and begins spending "experience points" on various other
   things.  The mathematical skill is not neglected, and the man still
   has much of the outlook of a mathematician, but the character has
   diversified.

   We can apply that to a character with Sword-19.  She has been training
   all her life to be a good swordswoman, and she has achieved it.  Now
   she goes out and tries to apply the sword to general situations.  She
   finds that being good with the sword is extremely useful in some
   situations, irrelevant in many, and positively dangerous in a few.
   She starts picking up other skills, partly because her ability with
   a sword is already good enough for most purposes, partly because
   acquiring further sword skill is getting difficult (well modelled in
   GURPS, less so in Hero), and partly because she really needs the
   diversification to get along.

   She will retain her basic philosophy that the sword is the answer,
   what's the question?  She will, to a large extent, see other skills
   as less direct ways of using a sword, or getting a sword into play,
   perhaps even as alternatives to a sword in some circumstances.  She
   will be happy when all the social and technical problems are cleared
   away and it's "This is my sword; what weapon do you choose to die
   with?" time.  But she will diversify, and she will become much
   more competent at situations not requiring mayhem.

   DHT

  I HAD an NPC character with something like Short Sword -19 in a GURPS 
campaign I ran. She usually put the experience points I gave her into 
something besides short sword because;
a) She really didn't fight much, and when she did, she usually outclassed
her opponants, and
b) the skills she was trying to develop were ones she found genuinely
useful. 
  If you have a character who has really specialized, and take him/her
to a situation where other skills turn out to be useful, don't you think
that that person might develop those skills?

  I prefer skill based systems to class/level based systems because
it allows you to better define your character. My swordswoman would
never use a melee weapon besides a sword, and she had obviously spent
a good deal of time learning how to use her swords. You can have a
character in AD&D who has double specialized in short sword, and
won't put other weapons in his remaining slots, but that has little
effect on actual gameplay. If I had created her as a "sword saint"
from AD&D's Oriental Adventures, the initial characterization would
have changed little. But she would have had little chance to grow or
change.

  As for AD&D having development slow down, as characters increase in 
experience, in most of the campaigns I know of, the adventures have
gotten tougher as the characters go up levels. Otherwise, the
adventure ceases to become a challenge. So the characters tend to 
advance at a steady rate. In GURPS, the players get a steady stream
of experience, but after a while diminishing returns set in. In normal
play, a character with short-sword 35 is little better than one with
short-sword 25, unless they're fighting each other. The only thing you
really have to look out far is people saving points and buying a skill,
when they have no justification for the character having learned that
skill. Level based systems are even more open to this abuse, since
their skills go up when they go up levels, even when they haven't 
used their skills in a long time.

Monday, 28 January 1991 01:45:46 UTC - Mutant for Hire:
My opinion on skill based systems versus class based systems, I feel that skill
based systems are superior in allowing detailed character definitions, but that
class based systems make it easier to create characters. In a sense, I see
class systems as a set of training wheels for people who aren't used to role
playing games. By simplifying the set of choices, a new player can choose a
type of character and have all the balancing decisions made for him/her.
In Shadowrun one has archetypes and in the Hero system the creative GM can make
package deals. Theoretically, one could rig up a full class system in a skill
based system simply by requiring how xp be spent after an adventure. But the
initial character conception is the hard part. Once the adventure is underway,
players can usually figure out where to spend experience.

Can anyone report some real experience with the reaction of beginners
to templates in point-based systems?  I have templates in my own (homebrew)
ruleset, but my players are all veteran game redesigners so threw out
mine and built their own.  I was hoping to start with some beginners
in a month or two, but hoped for some advice/reaction/etc beforehand.

Brent,
this is the most bizarre argument that roleplaying is immoral I've
ever seen :-)

Why is it lying for you to roleplay, but you don't consider your fellow
players to be lying?  (Or do you consider them liars?)

What is dishonest about it anyway?  Surely "lying" implies an attempt
to deceive.  If you tell someone a joke ("A guy walked into a bar
with a talking dog...") are you lying?  Do you not tell jokes for the
same reason you don't roleplay?  Would it be immoral for you to act in
a play?

I'm genuinely curious.  It seems as though you are restricting your life
for no reason.  Surely you can see that creating a fiction which your
audience knows is fiction is not lying or being dishonest...

Is there any other point based system other than Shadowrun where

I think one addition to Shadowrun might be to have more points available
for skills (slightly) if the character doesn't stock up on 6's, (the max

is such a premium on certain high skills in the game.

I _do_ like the class system approach, because if you don't differentiate
the roles of your team's characters, some become expendable, ;*) , and
you often have everyone being able to do the most commonly used skills about
equally, if only to maintain PC interest.  It adds to the mystique of some
characters who are very good at what they do, rather than some Jack-of-All

I take your point well.  I don't really run the sort of campaign where this
is a problem, I think, although I do sometimes forget things.  Only a
couple of sessions ago the party were given a Quest and I forgot to tell
them, so they weren't :-(.  Not to worry.

In any case, if for some strange reason there was something I desparetely
wanted to happen, I can't see how you could tell if it was planned or not,
as a player.  I wonder if we have different ways of looking at being a GM?
For me, there is no conflict between players and GM -- we are working
together at a kind of improvisational theatre.  We're not opponents, and
the players can neither win nor lose.  Which is why sometimes ten or more
sessions can go by with no-one remembering to advance their character's
little skill-numbers, or why their portrayal of the Person behind the Numbers
is more important than the Numbers.  My farourite campaigns or scenarios
have all been entirely without mechanics.  And mostly without any preparation
whatsoever, which is easy to do in my own still-being-written make-it-up-
as-I-go-along world called Anna than in Harn, which I'm using at the moment.

But I've typed for too long, sorry.  If you ever play in something I run --
and you'd be more than welcome, as long as you promise not to wear white
socks* -- perhaps I should tell you that everything is Written In Stone.
Or in Plastic, in a Modern RPG :-).  I don't mind.  Just don't expect me to
have more than an hour a week to prepare for a session, because I usually
don't.

     Obviously, I should have broken the above up into more sentences.
I *meant* that *using another name* struck me as dishonest.  That was
why I never *named my characters*.  That's why I only use my own name
when I play.  As for the "using another persona" part, that ties in
with using false names.  I don't use other personas under my own name
due to lack of skill.

     No, I don't consider other players to be lying.  As I tried to make
clear earlier, I only apply my system of ethics to myself.  Other people
can do whatever they want, and that's fine with me.  I don't consider
*them* to be dishonest.  However, if *I* did it, *I* would be--or so I
would feel.

     Nothing is dishonest about it at all.  The role-playing, I mean.
No, I don't think that it would be immoral to act in a play, though I
never would, since I am a *horrible*, *terrible* actor.  No talent at
*all*.

     Actually, my reasons for not playing roles have nothing to do with
any feeling of dishonesty.  I have no ethical reservations about it at
all.  I'm just extremely bad at it.  Since role-playing doesn't interest
me in the slightest (doesn't strike me as being fun at all, in fact),
I've never been motivated to try to improve whatever skills I might have
in that area.  As a matter of fact, the few times I've tried, I've ended
up feeling like a total idiot, and not had any fun at all, even from the
game itself.

     As I said before, I'm in it for the *game-playing*, not the
*role-playing*.

Hmm, you must run a different kind of theatre than I've ever seen.  I've never

The relationship between the GM and players matters most.  If the players can

If you are into cyberpunk RPG's you should take a look at Cyberpunk 2.0.2.0 by
R. Talsorian Games. It makes use of "Roles", aka templates. These provide the
basic background and special abilities that apply to that Role. Ex: Solos have
the special ability of Combat Sense which gives them a higher REF, aka
dexerity, thus they can react and act faster in a combat situation. They have a
basic menu of career skills, and can be built on different sets of points.

Well, if the players don't differentiate between the roles, it's because the GM
didn't tell them that they need an ex-wage mage, solo, or other types. While a
skill based system hasn't any classes per se, classes are a part of skill based
system, just not enforced. A fighter is anybody with more than, say 30-40% of
his intial skill points on combat oriented skills then his character is a
fighter. Likewise for mages and thieves. It all depends on how the GM runs his
game.

Well, there's Star Wars RPG where all of the stats are *fixed* during
creation.  The cost of improving skills is proportional to the skill
level to be improved.  (Ex: Star Wars is based on dice plus adds for
stats and skills.  A skill of 3D+1 requires 3 skill points to raise to
3D+2.  A skill of 5D+2 requires 5 skill points to raise to 6D.  PCs
usually earn 5-12 skill points per adventure.)

I've been working on a way to raise stats in Star Wars, but have
balked for certain reasons.  To other Star Wars GMs: Do you think that
a x5 multiplier for stat increases is steep enough?  How about x10?

I have been playing GURPS for three years now and have never
encountered the J-o-T problem.  Certainly, there are certain skills
that most of the PCs purchase (Primarily Stealth due to the sort of
adventures that my group favors), but the skill level varies widely
depending on conception.  (Our 'designated skulker' has a skill of 15+
while the rest of us make due with levels of 10-12.)  Also, everybody
has *some* skill with weapons (the mages realized from the outset that
there are situations where you don't have the *time* to cast spells.)
But only our 'frontline combat' PCs have mulitple combat skills in the 14+
range.  First Aid is also a common skill, but that is simple comon
sense.  After all, what happens if your 'designated medic' (Read
'Cleric' in D&D terms) has been rendered unconcious or worse by a
particularly nasty encouter?  Also, First Aid is of limited use, so
that those who specialize (Healing spells, high-tech medicine, etc.)
still shine when their services are called upon.

Most PCs will specialize because they soon realize that the cannot do
everything.  And those who do try to generalize find that they cannot
perform as well as the specialists in their field.

It seems to me that the time between a system of X power being a
good mainframe and a good desktop system is 10-15 years, and I see
no reason this will change.  Therefore, IMHO you will *not* own
the equivalent of a high-end CRAY this century.

Also, the task I have outlined is beyond current capabilities, requiring
as it does real-time semantic analysis of several voices in non-optimal
conditions.  Whether it could be done on current hardware, given the
software, is an interesting question; I would think not.

Therefore, allow 5-10 years to develop hardware good enough to do
this at all, and 10-15 years to bring it to the desktop (assume
the software can be ported, or that the concepts kinda filter down),
and we have the 20 years I suggested.

Um.  I really hope you are joking here.  I hardly consider one player's 
  obsession with information which is 99% likely to be totally irrelevant
  to the adventure to be a 'basic aspect of the game world'.  I've played
  with such people, and watched them slow the game to a crawl while they
  write down such important details as the pattern of the surcoats worn   
  by the city guardsmen.  

If someone is on the ball enough to have names and such information at

I've never had the expendability problem. If you have 2 characters who are
good in a fight or 2 mages does one become expendable? Nonsense! The only
people who have ever become expendable are the ones who don't involve
themselves in the proceedings.

My game breakdown is as follows:
Red Scorpion: Street Samuri
Des: Ex-gang memeber/ Warrior (not as deadly as Scorp, but more versatile)
Toshi: Samuri/ Decker (specialty is running naked on the matrix)
Silverball: Demolitions expert/ Pool Hustler (Normal reflexes)
Hagbard Celine: Rigger
Changeling: Hermetic Mage
Mongoose: Decker Supreme

Now take a wild guess as to who is expendable: Hagbard the Rigger. Why?
Simple, he doesn't get involved with the plot, just the action.

By your standards it would have been Des or Toshi since they are just
copies of what others can do.

I'm playing Star Wars, and at the moment even the experienced players are
using the templates. It's easier and there is enough range to cover most
of the options you might want. The most likely reason to design your own
template is with users of the Force. The existing Force user templates are
a very restricted set. You are a "Force user" character, whereas I was
thinking more along the lines of "Force using Pilot" or "Force using Senator"
etc. ie. be good at something else as well as using the Force. This may
indicate that in a fantasy setting people will muck about with the templates
most when their character involves magic wielding, again because the range
of character options becomes so wide that a standard set of templates
cannot possibly cover them all.

I'm a Star Wars player, and I'm very unhappy about the idea of being able
to raise stats. First of all, its one more thing you have to decide whether
or not to spend any of those precious skill points on. Then there's the
question of do all the skills under a given stat increase when the stat does?
When you create the character, the base skill levels are the value of the stat
they are under. If the skills do go up with the stat, raising a stat is very
powerful. If they don't go up, raising a stat is almost worthless unless it
is strength, which is what you roll against when you take damage. While we're
on strength, letting people increase that seems very dangerous - how much
damage you can take is fundamental to the game balance. Players will naturally
improve strength, but this will annoy the player playing the Wookiee who sees
his character's major advantage (high strength) being eaten away, and he
can't do anything about it because his strength is higher so it costs more
to increase so whatever he does the gap between him and frail humans will
close up if the humans are trying to increase strength. Back to increasing
stats in general. Say you increase your Strength stat from 3D+2 to 4D. You
have a Lifting skill (a Strength based skill) of 5D+2. Does this go up
to 6D? If so, I think you just got a very good deal out of increasing your
Strength. If not, then you wasted the skill points you spent on Lifting,
unless skills do not go up at all, even if this means the skills drop below
the stat they are under.

On to something I am a little unhappy about in the basic game. Characters
who start out with Force skills pay for each one they start with by having
one less die of stats. So for a Failed Jedi, he has only 16D spread around
the Stats instead of the normal 18D, as he has 1D Control and 1D Sense skill.
I don't like this, it is a major long term disadvantage that you can
never really throw off. It basically means they are crap at most skills. I
dislike it so much that I prefer to start a character as another template
(eg. Brash Pilot) and then learn Force skills from scratch. OK so you never
catch up with the Jedi in the group, but at least you can shoot a blaster
in vaguely the right direction and can fly a ship in a straight line. OK
so your increasing stats scheme would help, but I think it is the wrong answer.
I think the thing to do is distinguish between people who have no Force skills,
and those who have the skill with 0D skill code. So Jedi characters start with
the basic 18D of stats that everyone else does, and have 0D in their Force
skills. They can then increase their force skills with skill points. On
the other side of this argument, I've heard players complain that other
characters can start with really good skill codes, so why can't Jedi? A Brash
Pilot can muster 6D Starship Piloting and 6D Starship Gunnery as a starting
character, the best a Failed Jedi can do is 3D Control and 3D Sense, and doing
that is an unwise use of your starting 7D you get to add to skills anyway.
You are better off adding it to skills which are already high due to high
stats. Maybe this is all part of the game balance design, but it does mean
that as soon as you look at any character with Force skills, you have to think
an awful lot harder about where to spend those precious skill points and
starting 7D skill increases.

Consider Star Wars.  The character generation is a two-level point
system, but the templates provided make it extremely easy to use (and
have fooled people on the net into calling it a class system).
Advancement is unrestricted for skills (no advancement for attributes)
but no character is going to accumulate enough experience to break
out of the mold until the player is familiar with the system.  (There
are major differences in how fast characters advance in different
systems.  In D&D, an experienced character is far more powerful than
an inexperienced one; in Hero or Gurps or Star Wars, this is not
the case.)

In my experience, everybody wants time and attention for their character.
This usually translates into character power, since the character that
can do everything better than anybody else gets the time and attention.
This generally means that everybody wants their character to be more
powerful than everybody else's, or at least as powerful.
In a point-based system, everybody starts at the same level, and so
they can produce characters of roughly equal power and interest.
Such systems have a certain amount of fairness, although they
don't necessarily work well with strong character conceptions.

In such a system, voluntarily accepting disadvantages can be
disruptive.  The character doing such typically is less effective,
or monopolizes time and attention by dealing with them, or
inflicts his/her disadvantages on the entire group.  On the
other hand, playing characters with disadvantages is *fun*, as
anyone with experience in such systems will probably agree.

The unfortunate part of the point-mongering is that characters
tend to wind up with about the same number and value of disadvantages,
somewhat reducing the fun level.  Still, I find that the point-
based systems are more fun, for my friends and me, than dice
systems of character generation.

True.  I would like to point out that this applies to getting the
character ready to play in the game.  Actually finding a personality
suitable for the die-rolls that plays comfortably can take longer.
However, when I first encountered D&D (shortly before it was published)
I had no previous experience with role-playing, and therefore had no
complaints.  Nowadays, I would chafe at having to start with rolled
characteristics and no other personality clues.  Some people wouldn't.

>
>   (2) the milieu was familiar to most of the players (sword and
>       sorcery/dungeon crawl)

For when D&D was introduced, I strongly disagree.  Sword and sorcery
were things like Conan or Fafhrd and the Mouser or Moorcock.  If you
compare these with D&D as published, you will find little similarity.
D&D magic-users and clerics had little in common with Elric or the
Lords of Quarmall or Xaltotun.  Furthermore, our heroes (almost always
fighters, in D&D terms) rarely entered dungeons, and only for specific
purposes.  D&D *invented* the dungeon crawl, and the specs for the
magic-using types grew out of a set of tabletop miniatures rules.
Since D&D, of course, the concept of a dungeon crawl has become
popular, and I believe that D&D has drastically changed the role
of magicians in fantasy fiction.  They have become more powerful
tactically and less powerful strategically, and have lost most of
their wisdom and arcane knowledge (almost impossible to role-play).
IMHO, this is a loss for fantasy fiction, but the mysterious and
shadowy mages of yesteryear will probably return sometime.

I claim that D&D's success here is that (1) D&D was the first on
the scene, and therefore did not have to compete with more
sophisticated and potentially satisfactory systems, and (2) by
the time these systems were present, the public consciousness
had already been somewhat shaped by D&D.

Very true.  Even in the most sophisticated games I see nowadays,
there is at least one good fight per playing session.  It's fun.
It is also possible that my tastes have been changed by *years*
of hack-and-slash D&D, but I don't know whether this has made
me more or less fond of rolling dice while pretending to be
involved in a desperate and lethal combat.

>There is still a market for well thought out games where the

And a more fragmented one.  Hack-and-slash fantasy is the largest
subgenre (I could speculate on how much this is a cause as opposed
to a result of D&D's success), and it is greatly dominated by D&D.
Other subgenres are generally not dominated by one game to as great
an extent (IMHO).

Current fantasy seems to lack the depth of its predecessors.  Could it be that
the other older authors of fantasy were students of language, history,
myth, philosophy, etc while the new ones have only learned fantasy by reading
fantasy.

This is not strictly true. There are still people writing fantasy with a
strong backgrund in myth. Elizabeth Boyar comes to mind immediately. I can
also think of a couple of other books and authors but their titles and

Thursday, 31 January 1991 01:27:46 UTC - Ed Allen:
I've done a fair amount of programming of game aids on my Mac using
HyperCard for old D&D (1974 version with homebrew mods).  What
the computer has actually been good for so far:
Notekeeping of random jottings on how many charges some item has or what's
going to happen to some character.  I find these easier now.  Always used
to write on scraps that got lost or backs of notebooks that got smudged or
sheets that got buried.

Large quantities of table rolling.  When I need a random treasure, I hit
the screen button for the appropriate size of treasure and let the computer
roll it's way through the tables, then read the list and change as desired.

Quick experience points calculations.  My favorite formula is
level of monster squared times 40,60, or 80 depending on whether it has
special abilities and then dividing among the PCs involved in the combat.
I've tailored a routine that's easier to do than using a calculator.

Storing NPCs.

Storing Spell lists of spells created by me or players.

PLAYING SOUND EFFECTS - Hooked to the stereo or a boom box, the Mac can
do some really fun things for fight sounds, traps, sounds behind doors
and monster roars.  A couple of times, sounds digitized for specific events
went over really well, like the use of catch phrases recorded by a player
who'd moved away for his characters that had become NPCs.  The other players
were amazed when he joined in on a conversation on a predictable theme without
being there.  This capability is now available for most PCs and can add alot
if you're willing to put in the time to collect, organize, and record sounds.

Storing maps.  Since mine are in HyperCard, they're clickable to get local
blowups or site descriptions (this can take a lot of time to develop).

Minor NPC generation - wrote a stack that creates boatloads of pirate
NPCs for a GURPs pirates campaign.  It was fun for the cast of thousands
effect.

What hasn't worked so well:

Showing pictures - even with a swivel stand it's awkward and hasn't usually
had the right impact.

Running combats - So far I haven't come across a good way to involve the
computer in combat without it being more cumbersome than it's worth.  I want
to be paying attention to my players while running the game and not messing
with entering factors that influence dice rolls and basically doubling effort
by telling the computer all the same info I tell the players.  This may vary
with combat system, with systems that have a lot of table lookups like
*-Law being more amenable to computer aided combat, where the computer
replaces a sheaf of crit tables.

Storing PCs - I'm too lazy to type in all the changes after each session
and have trouble with some of my players' handwriting.

General world modelling might be nice but I don't have the time for it.
The closest I get is computerized weather tables, notes on campaign
plots, events, people, and localities.

I suggest a multiplier equal to the number of skills under the stat.  Any
skill which is below the stat at its raised level, gets increased to the
level of the stat; any skill above the level of the stat stays where it is.
In other words, after the stat is increased, no skill under that stat may
have a rating less than the stat - alter the skills where necessary.

I'd disagree with that.  Dexterity is also useful, especially if you're using
the newer combat rules (as supplied in the Rules Companion).  Perception is
also useful to increase.

Solution: you aren't allowed to increase a stat to more than, say, 1D above
its original value.

"The power to destroy a planet is insignificant when set against the power of
the Force."  So says Darth Vader, and he should know what he's talking about.
Anyone care to argue?

Even at the starting levels of a new character (who, if he has any sense, is
going to put as much into those Force skills during generation as possible)
the character gets to do a bunch of things that other characters can't even
learn to do.  That idea about starting out as, say, a Brash Pilot and learning
Force skills later is fine, provided the GM allows you to find a master who
can teach you.  (You did see the small print which says that only a master
with at least 7D can teach an unskilled character the use of Force skills,
didn't you?)  Also note the small print about Force-using characters being
very reluctant to kill - if you're going to role-play properly, he should
not use his blaster a lot anyway.

Don't forget that increasing Force skills takes double the cost in skill
points.  Increasing that 3D Control to 3D+1 will take 6 points.

Correct in all respects.  The idea is that (at the start, at least) no
character is powerful at everything - everyone has their own speciality,
and must work together to be successful.  Think of a Force using character
as equivalent in some respects to a AD&D magic user.

While this is probably true for most modern fantasy, there are counter
examples, notably Nicolai Tolstoys Merlin books (the first is called
"The Coming of the King". I don't know if the sequel is out yet).
Tolstoy is an expert of celtic mythos, and the book is filled to the
point of almost unreadability with references to mythic characters and
episodes, not to mention lots of phrases in gaelic or saxon.

Random rolls just mean lots of possible things you'd stick in your campaign
anyway.  Essentially what you just said was:  Any author who does it entirely
off the top of their head gets into a rut.  I doubt that many if any at
all famous writers use random events unless they are recording what happened
in their game.

Yes, some of what happens to people are just supposed to be isolated
encounters.  A bad-storytelling GM doesn't include those.  A bad-storytelling
GM decides what the story is going to be in advance.  There is a huge
difference between following the script and finding out what the players
want to do and then running with it.  I think players are much more
creative usually than a bunch of silly dice.

Agreed.  Actually with any other group of players I wouldn't look at my
notes.  I'd _invent_ the colour of the wallpaper.
You seem (David) to expect us poor GMs not only to have mapped out the entire
world to the last sub-mollecular detail, but to have _memorised_ it as well!

I don't think you'll find many people doing this.  The ones you think _are_
doing it are simply good fakers.  It's a waste of time generating huge
amounts of data that'll never be used.
Of course, it can also be fun, but not when taken to the extreme you seem

How on earth could you run a city adventure with (say) 100,000 people in the
city, if you had to know all their names, who know whom, and what they all
ate for breakfast?  Are you serious?

Which is not at all what I was suggesting.  I was, in fact, suggesting that a 
good GM should be a good faker, but that's a bad term.  A good GM should have
developed an intuitive grasp of the nature and probabilities of his world, 
so that when players come up with something unexpected or ask for minor 
detail, the GM has in his mind the basic parameters and likelihoods of the
reality so that he can generate a viable answer on the spot.  This facility
may SEEM like faking, but it is really the ability to create a world background
with the consistency and substance which make it seem real, and to internalize
and extrapolate from that basic structure.

This is EXACTLY what I was talking about when I said that computers and random

Such things as random treasure and experience based on monster killing is from
the dark ages of gaming, and even if you are enjoying the other benefits of
the original edition of D&D, there's no reason to hang these millstones around

Friday, 1 February 1991 20:17:16 UTC - Nathaniel Pryce:
   People have been discussing the raising of basic attributes in Star Wars
RPG. Here are my thoughts on the matter:
1. PCs are already heroes and well above the norm for their race. Increasing 
   attributes will make them even more powerful, and so difficult to control,
   both by the GM and by the law-keepers in the campaign - remember that a lot 
   of Star Wars PCs are criminals with no shred of decency, who are involved 
   with the Rebellion either through misfortune or for what they can get!!
 
2. The stats are really general statements. The skills are more detailed 
   statements about the character. 
   Eg: If a PC tried to increase his pure physical strength, his Lifting skill
   would be increased. The STR stat is more a measure of how well built the
   _whole_ of a character's body is: how well it can stand shock, how well it
   can build muscle, how well it can withstand strain. The same applies to the 
   other attributes and skills.
     If a character wants to use skill points to improve, he can only increase 
   his skills.

3. If a PC wants to increase a basic attribute, make it an expensive, dangerous 
   and difficult business. For instance, If he wanted to increase his strength,
   he would need to buy technological body implants. Who would do this to him?
   Is it legal? Is it expensive? (You bet it is!) What are the risks?
   - If he wanted to increase his dex, he would need extensive neurosurgery. 
   - If he wanted better knowledge, implanted wetware or a brain supercharger 
     would be needed, or perhaps a symbiotic alien creature living in his 
     skull!!

     If the processes are not legal, the risks would be great. PCs would only 
   be able to get work done by dodgy medics, who may not be good at their job,
   since most of the difficult surgery is done by droids.
     The Imperials might raid the clinic during the op, or while they are
   recovering. The surgery may go wrong, or malunction at a later date. Perhaps
   the surgeon is working for the ISB and implants some undesirable features.
   There are certainly a lot of plot lines to be extracted from this kind of
   scenario.

   I admit that some of these ideas sound rather cyberpunk, but what the heck,
   SF has come on a bit since Star Wars was first created!

Anyway, there are a few ideas. The alien brain critter I just thought up, and 
may use in my campaign. Other ideas are already in use, and although my players
haven't used them yet, they should know how to find them.

Hope this gives you some good ideas. It's certainly got my brain humming. (I'll
have to get my superchargers tuned!)

There is a Jedi Master on the small (minute? miniscule?) rebel base we are
attached to. I brought the Pilot character in from a different campaign. In
the other campaign, the GM kept hinting that my character was a latent
force user (she felt the destruction of Alderan, felt Darth Vader's
presence when we arrived shortly after the battle of Yavin and a couple
of other minor incidents). So, I started looking for a Jedi Master. After
some time it became clear I was not going to find one. This annoyed me
intensely as the GM had started it all from some minor point in the
character history. Why hint at force skills, and then make it impossible
to learn them? So, knowing of the Jedi Master in the other group already,
I switched the character over. Note that it is not easy to get this guy
to teach you anything, as the Failed Jedi found out when he wanted to learn
Alter. He did finally manage it though. Also this GM has other ways to get
Force skills - if you accumulate 10 Force points (very unlikely I admit)
you can trade them in for 1D in either Sense or Control. He claims this
is just the same as a Quixotic Jedi having sense without being trained, and
it is a rather intriging idea. I do feel that being able to accumulate 10
Force points is sick, but he is fairly liberal with force points - it is
not unknown to get more Force points than skill points for an adventure.
The really HARD bit is going to be getting my hands on a lightsaber.
Spending the skill points on learning lightsaber tech to build one is
awkward too as I'll need all the points I can get to learn Force skills
from the ground up. Not to meantion the half dozen other skills I want to
work on. Oh well, such is life. This is all assuming we ever make it back
out of Otherspace - this module is giving me really bad vibes, it goes
beyond "I've got a bad feeling about this".

I've done basically this sort of thing in HyperCard for my old-style D&D
campaign.   The limitations are more in the creation and entering of the
contents than the development of the program structure.  It's similar to
the time you'll take to flesh out your world in detail manually.  Some
things go a little faster, some slower.  For example, you can have the
machine roll up an endless number of stereotyped NPCs of of tables.  The
moment you start to embellish one with friends, foes, specially designed
magic items or spells, residence info, political ties, attitudes, mannerisms,
etc. is the moment it bogs down and starts taking real time out of your life.
Maps that you click on for detail maps or local descriptions are fun to make
but time consuming if you start to really fill in all of those merchants in
a good size town or castles in a country.

The computer is a nice storage medium with better access than piles of note
books and loose maps and papers.  But it doesn't go much beyond that in
 info handling.

I am looking forward to a decent lightweight laptop Mac for a gamemastering
machine.   I'm tired of the overhead of lugging a Mac Plus to games and then
doing all the setup stuff of reassembling the system and plugging in.

Wednesday, 20 February 1991 14:51:48 UTC - Dave Lewis:
I've been GMing and playing RPGs for almost twenty years. My linage is:
D&D, AD&D, RQ, Macrocosm(my homebrewed system), Hero, Gurps, Cyberpunk,
Shadowrun, and back to Hero. I've looked at a lot of other systems, but
I've only listed the ones I've acutally run.
Last night we played session fifteen of the best campaign I've ever been
in and I saw a problem from the player's side, that I'd run into as a GM.

The game had been going along great. We had mostly been concerned with 
fending off our enemies and dealing with other facits of our character 
concpetions, but we also had fallen into a few minor political situations 
that ended up causing us a great deal of trouble with the law.  In other
words we had been dealing with the usual Swords&Sorcery kind of stuff.

We settled our differences with the authorities and hired out to help an 
NPC mage who was going to explore a ruin in the desert. Getting there, 
as always, was an adventure in itself. We spent an entire session on 
dealing with the guardians of the ruin and though we were successful, 
we got stompped pretty good, loosing one PC. We got Dalimar (the mage) 
into a very interesting part of the ruin (the library of a long dead 
arch-mage) and then proceeded to collect as much loot as we could. 

Later Dalimar emerged from the library and gave us a run-down on what he had 
learned (here comes the problem), the ruin was from the previous age
where magic had reached a much greater level than the current time. Magic
was also the cause of the fall of that civilization. Dalimar implied
that the release of the knowledge that he had found could be a threat to
the entire world. As Dalimar continued Kyle (my character) and me (the 
player) could feel the campaign shifting gears (CRUNCH, GRRRIND). Kyle 
became more and more alienated from the discussion, he knows very little 
about history or magic and dosn't much care. It became clear that the GM 
was leading us to a point where we would have to make decisions that would 
effect the whole world ("High Fantasey" choir in the background). 

I tried to determine how Kyle would deal with this and the best I could do 
was: "I don't need this crap! War is about to break out. I borrowed a lot of
gold from dad (the Baron of de Karis province) to ransom Flinch (another PC) 
back from Paris Jacobii and I'm sure he's hurting now if he hasn't fallen
already. I've got enough now to pay him back and then some. I should be 
heading home to help out, not getting into things that are way beyond me!" 

I didn't say any of this because I felt it would have been disruptive and 
as a GM who has had to deal with too many disruptive players, I couldn't 
bring myself to do it even though it would have been completely in character. 
Instead I just sat there and listened to about an hour long discussion 
about the pros and cons and possible plans for dealing with the situation 
(this discussion took place between the GM and ONE of the four players). 
I became aware of how I must seem to an outside observer and realized 
that the glazed look that must have been in my eyes was something that I 
had seen before. Yes on players in my games just before they fall apart!

I think the GM must have felt that he had challenged us as much as he could
and so he needed to up the ante. Wrong, at least for me. I would have been
perfectly happy to continue as before.

Has anyone else seen that glazed eye look?

 Yes, two of my fighters glazed out a short while ago.

 They had found an underground orcs' nest and cast a Portal spell on one of the
walls to get in. They did not, however
 (i) Talk quietly about their plans
 (ii) cast a spell to see what was on the other side
 (iii) Get in quickly
They went in at one every 10 seconds.
The 4 orcs on the far side knocked out the first guy, paralysed the next from
the waist down and started on the next as he came out.  The fighters were
pretty bored for the next hour, but then, THEY DESERVED IT!

I'll vouch for this sort of thing having happened in campaigns I've been in
from both sides too (DM and player), although I'll admit that it's never
quite happened in such an obvious and clear-cut way as the way you described.

What I have seen happen, is that fairly minor DM decisions have been made
which annoyed the players (not the characters), and this has caused some bad
feeling, which has caused everyone's 'suspension of disbelief' (I hate that
phrase !) to shatter, or at least start to crumble at the edges.  The result
of this is that an adventure which up to then was well enjoyed, starts to be
considered more cynically, and unless something happens to stop it, the
adventure or even campaign can indeed fall apart.

Very recently, from a player's point of view, I participated in an adventure
which started off fine - the scenario was well thought out, the party worked
on finding out what was going on, and all was progressing well.  Then the DM
struck a sad blow to the adventure.  He revealed some crucial information,
(which we might have just about been able to deduce), and basically pushed us
along where we didn't want to go.  After that, most of us turned cynical, and
just went along with what the DM wanted us to do, just to get the adventure
over !  Thus what could have been an exceedingly enjoyable adventure was
spoilt, and the campaign put under a little strain.

Fortunately, our group has a few ways to get over such bad periods.  Although
I am the 'campaign DM', after a few adventures, or when people think a change
would be a good idea, one of the players becomes 'Guest DM', we confer over
things which require overall campaign knowledge, and then he/she is free to
run an adventure or two in my world.  This change of DM generally results in
a change of adventure style, which refreshes the campaign as a whole, and so
the current campaign has been going for well over a year now (sessions once 
a week).

Another important way to avoid such tensions from lasting too long is to tell
the DM after an adventure (or session) what (if anything) spoilt the session
for you.  Constructive criticism helps alot, as the DM will have a better
chance of avoiding the pitfalls next time !

Yes, and felt it, also, again usually when a character who isn't suited
to be doing soemthing, and woudn't be, in  character doing it, is forced
into having to do something (By DM or circumstance) they woudn't give
two carrots for.
