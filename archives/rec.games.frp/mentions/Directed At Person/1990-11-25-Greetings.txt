Yup.  Second edition is "in progress".  Trying to get all of
the glitches out (and maintain a household, hold down a job, and
run herd on a collection of lunatics).

I remember you, Pierre.  Glad we could meet on the net again (it
should be obvious that my posts are being gated by someone else).

I'm using Generic Cadd right now to do up a starmap of the Hegemony
with major regional capitols displayed (and as soon as I get around
to buying the convert package, I'll be able to put the result into
DXF format).  The joys of modern PC technology...
