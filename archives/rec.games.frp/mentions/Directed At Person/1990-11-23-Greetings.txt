   Nicolai!  Liked your game of OTHER SUNS, and heard a rumour that it might
be re-released in a 2nd edition.  To tell the truth, I admired this SF game
more than any other, because its game mechanics were all skill-based with
effects on critical rolls.
   You may not remember me, but I once sent you a map in which I *TRIED* to
map all the races of the Hegemony in keeping with the "future history"
tabulated in the game.  But of course I goofed by separating two races who,
according to one line in the history, should be neighbouring.
