I'm not sure.  My first character, Mediocre Fred (later Lord Frederick
Finagle) was male, my second was female, and for the most part thereafter
in D&D I tended to flip a coin.  Currently most of my characters aren't
even human since almost all of my gaming has been in Other Suns and
with all of the other species to choose from why play a human being when
I'm THAT all the time in the real world?  I think of the bisexual species
I probably play about as many male as female, while my Rayenne character,
Tref is hermaphroditic (but then ALL Rayenne are hermaphroditic - they're
a race of swamp-dwelling tentacular aliens I came up with shortly after
seeing Star Wars for the first time and decided it was time I came up
with something weird.)
