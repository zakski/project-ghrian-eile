                                OTHER SUNS: CHAPTER 2  COPYRIGHT 1982, 1989 by N. C. Shapero

                                CHARACTERISTICS
        To create an Adventurer, the player rolls dice for each of the following characteristics. This provides the basic parameters of the Adventurer's
development. The die rolls given are for  humans. Other intelligent races may use different die rolls for the various characteristics. These differences are
dealt with in CHAPTER 4, INTELLIGENT SPECIES.

        1.  Strength (STR): helps determine the damage a character does, how much equipment he can carry, and what weapons he may use. Strength can be
increased  through training up to the rating for the character's Constitution or Size, which ever is larger. Humans roll for strength on 3D6.

        2.  Intelligence (INT): the character's ability to deal with abstractions and to learn from experience. Intelligence  for humans in the general
population is rolled on 3D6. However, adventurous characters -- the spacers, the scientists, the space merchants -- are all a cut above average. Thus all
human adventuring characters (i.e. all player run humans) roll for INT on 2D6+6.

        3.  WILL (WIL): the character's strength of will and ego -- an important factor in the ability to resist and/or power certain kinds of psionic attack
and possibly to affect the world through direct force of will (see CHAPTER 7, PSIONICS AND THE USE OF WILL). Will is also a  measure  of the character's
overall self-confidence. Will can be increased through training up to the species maximum.  Humans roll for Will on 3D6.   

        4.  Constitution (CON): the character's health. It helps determine how much punishment (in combat or otherwise) a character can take before he dies.
Constitution can be increased through training up to the maximum of Strength or Size. Constitution is rolled on 3D6  for humans in the general population.
However, adventurous characters -- the spacers, the  scientists, the space merchants, are all a cut above average. Thus all adventuring characters (i.e. all
player run characters) roll for CON on 2D6+6. 

        5.  Endurance (END): the character's ability to withstand pain and to engage in strenuous  activity for prolonged periods of time. Endurance is also
a factor in determining how much physical punishment a character can take. Endurance can be increased through training up to species maximum. Humans roll for
endurance on 4D10.

        6. Dexterity (DEX): the character's ability to move quickly and accurately. Dexterity may be increased through training up to species maximum. Humans
roll for dexterity on 3D6.

        7. Charisma (CHA): the character's ability to lead. It is the ability to say "follow me" and find oneself leading a charge. Charisma is subject to
change (both up and down) depending upon the success or failure of previous ventures. Humans roll for charisma on 3D6.

        8. Length (LEN):  the height of the character, in centimeters (1 inch = 2.54 centimeters; 1 centimeter = 0.394  inches). This characteristic
determines the reach of the character. It also helps determine the overall body mass of the character, the principal factor in the amount of total damage the
 character can take before dying. It is assumed that all Adventurers have reached their full growth prior to entering play, so this characteristic cannot
 increase during the course of the characters career. Humans roll for LEN on 110+6D20 for male characters, and on 100+6D20 for female characters.

        9. Build (BLD): the massiveness of the character's bone structure -- indicating how stocky, and how bulky the Adventurer's body is -- the higher the
roll, the stockier the build. It is an important factor in determining the overall size of the character (and hence his ability to withstand damage). This
characteristic may only change by one point from the original roll once the Adventurer has begun his career. Human males roll for BLD on 3D6, human females
roll for  BLD on 3D4+1. 

        10. Telepathic Strike Capability (TSC): the measure of the character's ability to launch telepathic attacks, to probe minds, and to handle psionic
devices. There is no species maximum for TSC and no limit to the amount of training that may be applied towards increasing this characteristic. Humans roll
for TSC on 1D6-5. Characters  with TSC less than or equal to 0 are non-telepathic (though they may be trained). 

        11. Telepathic  Resistance (TPR): the measure of the character's resistance to telepathic probes and  attacks. There is no species  maximum for
telepathic  resistance, and  TPR  may be trained  without  limit. Humans roll for telepathic resistance on 1D4+1.

******************************************************* 
        To provide a running series of examples for the reader, we will be presenting the tale of Mikhail Andreivitch throughout this book. For now, let's
roll up his characteristics...   

        STR=12 -- A high average STR, allowing Mikhail to  handle most weapons without penalties. See CHAPTER 10, COMBAT, for more details on the precise limits
involved. 

        INT=17 -- An excellent roll. As will be seen later, it gives him a number of advantages in gaining expertise in skills. His starting skills will also
be much improved (see CHAPTER 6, PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE) by this high intelligence.

        WIL=9 -- A below average roll. So Mikhail's force of will and strength of ego are, perhaps, a little bit below average, but not enough to cause him
any serious difficulty. However, his WIL score is sufficiently low that he might as well give up any hope of developing anything of the psionic "wild
talents" until his WIL score can be improved (see CHAPTER 8, PSIONICS AND THE USE OF WILL for more details).

        CON=9 -- A below average roll. And Mikhail Andreivitch will be somewhat vulnerable to  disease  and  poison. Obviously, the Man of Steel he is not.

        END=22 -- A strictly average roll. So Mikhail is able to take just about as much pain as the next person before passing out, and of working just about
as hard (STR and CON permitting). 

        DEX=18 -- The highest roll for a Human. Obviously, what Mikhail lacks in bodily strength and toughness, he more than makes up for in speed and
agility. He will be able to use all equipment and weapons a bit better than average as a result of his quick reflexes and great agility. 

        CHA=13 -- At this point, Mikhail is a bit above average as a leader. This has nothing to do with his looks. 

        LEN=180 -- Mikhail is 180 centimeters tall, or roughly 5'11".

        BLD=9 -- Mikhail is not particularly heavily boned, but he is no lightweight either -- just on the low side of average.

        TSC=1 -- Mikhail is an active telepath, though a poor one by the standards of the era. His range is only 10 meters, and he has a 10% chance of
communicating with another equally adept telepath.

        TPR=3-- A typical average telepathic resistance. So Mikhail, though telepathic himself, has no particularly great resistance to telepathic probes
and/or attacks. Yet.   

MIKHAIL'S POTENTIAL INCREASES :

        STR -- Mikhail's STR can be increased to 20 (his SIZ).

        INT -- Failing some incredible miracle, Mikhail will be stuck with his current INT (not that he would complain, mind you)

        WIL -- This characteristic may be increased up to species maximum eventually, though Mikhail has a long way to go here.
         
        CON -- Mikhail may increase his CON, as explained  later, to a maximum of 20 (his SIZ).

        END -- This attribute can be increased to the species maximum, as explained later, though in Mikhail's case it would take many months of training to
do so. 

        DEX -- This attribute can be increased to the species maximum, as explained later.   

        CHA -- As shown later, Mikhail's CHA will rise and fall with events.   

        LEN -- As with INT, Mikhail is stuck with his current length. He is assumed to have finished his growth by the time he enters play. 

        BLD -- Though difficult, it would be possible for Mikhail to change his BLD by 1 point (either up or down).  See Increasing Characteristics later in
        this  chapter  for   further details. 

        TSC -- The sky is the limit for Mikhail in this area. 

        TPR -- Here again, the sky is the limit, though training this characteristic is both expensive and time consuming.
******************************************************* 

                                MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM CHARACTERISTICS
        No characteristic save TSC and TPR may be increased by any means save cyborging (see CHAPTER 12, HEGEMONIC TECHNOLOGY) beyond the maximum amount
rollable on the characteristic dice plus the number of dice rolled (plus one if an adder is present). Thus a human may not have a dexterity higher than 21
(=18+3), and a Korli with dexterity rolled on 3D6+6 may not have a dexterity higher than 28 (= 24 + 3 + 1).

        The  minimum characteristic possible for any reason is the number of dice rolled (for example, 3 for human CON). No characteristics save END and  WIL
may be reduced below this point voluntarily. If WIL is reduced below zero, however, the character dies, and  no amount of medical assistance will prevent his
 death or later restore him to life.
                                COMPUTED CHARACTERISTICS
        SIZE (SIZ): This is a combined indicator of the mass and bulk of the character. SIZ = (LEN/10) + (BLD/3) - 1 where fractions are rounded up to the
next largest whole number.

*******************************************************
Mikhail's SIZ = (180/10) + (9/3) - 1 = 18 + 3 - 1 = 20. 
******************************************************* 

        MASS (MAS): The total mass of the character (in  kilograms). MAS = (SIZ3)/100 (cube the size, and divide the result by 100). One kilogram mass equals
2.2 pounds weight (in a  1 gee gravitational field).

*******************************************************
Mikhail's  MAS  = (20 * 20 * 20)/100 = 8000/100 = 80 kilograms (a fairly hefty 176 pounds in a 1 gee field).
*******************************************************

        HIT POINTS (HIT): Hit points are the measure of how much damage the character can take before he dies. Total hit points are determined as follows: 
            (1) multiply SIZ by 2/3, and take the next  largest whole number;
            (2) multiply CON by 1/3, subtract 3, and take the next largest whole number; 
            (3) multiply END by 1/4, subtract 5, and take the next largest whole number;
            (4) multiply WIL by 1/8, subtract 1, and take the largest whole number LESS THAN this value.
            (5) add the results of calculations (1) through (4); the result is the total hit points for the character.

*******************************************************       
Mikhail is SIZ 20: calculation 1 yields 20 x  2/3 or 40/3 which equals 13 1/3. The next largest whole number is 14.
Mikhail's CON is 9: calculation 2 yields (9/3) - 3 = 0.  
Mikhail's END is 22:  calculation 3 yields (22/4) - 5 or 5.5 - 5 = 0.5, and taking the next largest whole number yields a result of 1 in this calculation.  
His WIL is 9: calculation 4 yields (9/8) - 1 or 1/8, which rounds down to 0.
Thus Mikhail will have 14 + 0 + 1 + 0 hit points for a total of 15 hit points. 
*******************************************************

        DAMAGE (DAM): Damage represents the ability to combine strength and mass to do more damage to an opponent than is ordinarily done by a hand to hand
or natural weapon.
        
        STR+SIZ                 ADDED DAMAGE (melee weapons)     ADDED DAMAGE(thrown weapons)
        01-15                   -1D4                             -1D4
        16-31                   0                                0
        32-41                   +1D4                             +1D2
        42-50                   +1D6                             +1D3
        51-58                   +1D8                             +1D4
        59-66                   +2D6                             +2D3
        Each further +8         +1D6                             +1D3

*******************************************************
Mikhail  has  a SIZ of 20, and a STR of 12, for total of 32. Thus, consulting the table, we see that he has a damage bonus of +1D4.
******************************************************* 

      LUCK (LUC): Luck may be described as the ability to fall into a compost heap and find a diamond. Unlike most the other abilities  listed, Luck is given
as a straight point value. Depending upon the difficulties or the odds involved, a player will have roll at or below some multiple (between one and six) for
this characteristic on 1D100 in order to have "made a luck roll". This procedure is referred to elsewhere in the rules as a "characteristic roll" (in this
case, for LUC). LUC = (INT + WIL) / 2 where  fractions  are rounded up to the next largest whole number.

*******************************************************
Mikhail has a luck of 13, computed as follows: (INT + WIL)/2 = (17 + 9)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Mikhail's high intelligence more than compensates for his below
average will, resulting in a luck value of 13   (well above average).
*******************************************************

                                ABILITIES BONUSES AND HOW CHARACTERISTICS INFLUENCE THEM
    Each character has various skills which he will be able to improve through training and experience; his characteristics will influence how well he will do
in each category of skill. Positive modifiers add to the category bonus, negative modifiers subtract from the characteristic bonus. Primary modifiers add
(subtract) twice the characteristic value to (from) the category bonus. Secondary modifiers add (subtract) the characteristic value to (from) the category
bonus. Tertiary modifiers add (subtract) one half of the characteristic value to   (from) the category bonus. 

    All primary, secondary, and tertiary positive and negative modifiers are added, then the Finagle Factor is then added to the result to give the final
category bonus; the Finagle Factor has been defined so that a typical Human character will have a zero category bonus. 

    ACCURACY (ACC): Accuracy measures the ability to handle aimed weapons (such as bows, crossbows, pistols, and rifles). 
    Positive Primary Modifiers: INT, DEX    Positive Secondary Modifiers: WIL       Positive Tertiary Modifiers:  (none)
    Negative Tertiary Modifiers:  (none)    Negative Secondary Modifiers: (none)    Negative Primary Modifiers:   (none)
    Finagle Factor: -52

******************************************************* 
Mikhail has  an accuracy bonus of  +27%, computed as follows:
2 x INT = 34
2 x DEX = 36
1 x WIL =  9
===============           
Subtotal = +79
Finagle =  -52
=============== 
Total = +27
Obviously, Mikhail is a natural rifleman... 
*******************************************************

        ATTACK (ATT): Attack measures the adventurer's added ability to strike at an opponent with a hand to hand or natural weapon (hands, teeth, feet, etc). 
        Positive Primary Modifiers: INT, DEX    Positive Secondary Modifiers: STR, WIL  Positive Tertiary Modifiers:  (none)
        Negative Tertiary Modifiers:  (none)    Negative Secondary Modifiers: (none)    Negative Primary Modifiers:   (none)
        Finagle Factor: -63

*******************************************************
Mikhail  has an attack bonus of +28%, computed as follows:
2 x INT = 34
2 x DEX = 36
1 x STR = 12
1 x WIL =  9
===============
Subtotal = +91
Finagle =  -63
===============
Total   =   +28 
******************************************************* 

      DODGE (DOD): The Dodge is adventurer's ability to avoid being where an  attack is directed. The dodge ability, unlike the Martial Arts Evasion skill
(described in detail in CHAPTER 5, SPECIALTIES AND SKILLS), may not be used to avoid attacks with most modern high velocity or energy weapons (it may be
applied against the taser and the shoulder fired rocket, both described in  CHAPTER  9,   COMBAT  SKILLS). In addition, it may not be applied against area
effect weapons (such as hand grenades -- also  described  in CHAPTER 9). In addition, if the adventurer is immobilized, unconscious, or surprised, his
dodge ability may not be employed. A negative value for the natural dodge ability is treated as a zero dodge ability in combat (thus, it is no easier than
normal for the attacker to hit a creature with a negative dodge ability).
 
    How the Dodge Works:
    Applied versus a Single Opponent's Single Attack:
    An attacker must subtract the defender's Dodge ability from his attack, PROVIDED that the defender could see the attack coming. If an opponent has a
dodge ability of 14%, and the attacker has a 47% chance of hitting with a broadsword, then the attacker has only a  33% chance of hitting that opponent with
his attack.

    Applied versus Multiple Opponents:
    When facing several foes or multiple attacks from a single opponent in one melee round, a character may apply all of his Dodge ability against one
attack, hoping the all other attacks will miss, divide his Dodge among the attacks of all the opponents, or dodge some, but not all of his foes' attacks. Thus,
a character with a 40% Dodge against four attackers each of whom is attacking once in the melee round may apply all of his Dodge against one, or put whatever
Dodge he wishes against each foe, so long as the total Dodge applied against all attacks in that melee round totals no more than 40%.
 
   How Dodge is Increased
   As a character's DEX or WILL increases, his Dodge ability will also increase. And each time that his Dodge saves him from an attack (i.e. the use of the
Dodge ability resulted in an attack failing where it would otherwise have succeeded) the adventurer has a chance of increasing his Dodge ability by 1D10%.
The player must roll the INT of the character or less on 1D100 in order for the Dodge ability to increase through use. This roll may be attempted once for
each successful use of the Dodge ability during the course of an expedition, though the Dodge ability may only be increased once per expedition. (Thus if
Mikhail Andreivitch used the Dodge ability three times in an expedition, the player running this character would have three opportunities to roll 17 or less
on  1D100. And even if two of those rolls were made, the Dodge ability would only improve once for this expedition, by 1D10 percentile points).

NOTE: This rule is in total contrast to the usual experience increasing rules shown elsewhere. If a character has no natural Dodge, it cannot be improved by
this method until, through increase in DEX and/or WIL, the character acquires a Dodge ability.
