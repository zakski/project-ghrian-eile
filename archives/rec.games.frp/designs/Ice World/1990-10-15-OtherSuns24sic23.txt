details).

Once  a  character has been immersed, all clothing  worn  (except
modern  suits, as above, or items worn under such suits)  becomes
ineffective  for protection from cold. Aquatic Skiltaire  do  not
lose the protection of their fur: other furred Hegemonic sophonts
do. Stage III Dakti shells will also shed water, and will  regain
their  normal  protective value once removed from the  water.  In
addition,  the  wind speed is doubled for purposes  of  computing
apparent  temperature, and a hypothermia check is required  every
CON+SIZ-20 MINUTES with HALF normal chance to avoid  hypothermia.
These  checks continue until the character has been dried off  or
gone into hypothermia.

Snow  Blindness: Ice and snow are highly reflective not  only  of
light  but  also of ultraviolet; on a bright day,  the  reflected
glare  of  snow and ice can dazzle, temporarily  blind,  or  even
permanently  damage the eyes of characters who are not  protected
from  it adequately. This is especially true on  worlds  orbiting
unusually  bright  stars, or occupying an orbit that  results  in
more light than a being is accustomed to striking the surface.

The  basic chance of avoiding dazzle is CONx5 (rolled on  1D100).
This  is modified by primary star type and orbital radius of  the
homeworld  of the character and the world he is currently  on  as
follows:

(1)  Add  the Dazzle factor for the primary  of  the  character's
racial homeworld to the basic chance;
(2)  Subtract the Dazzle factor for the primary of the  world  on
which the character is adventuring from the result;
(3)  Add  the  Dazzle factor for the orbital  distance  from  its
primary  of the character's racial homeworld to the  result  from
(2);
(4) Subtract the Dazzle factor for the orbital distance from  its
primary  of the world on which the character is adventuring  from
the result from (3);
(5)  If  there is no reflective material present  (such  as  ice,
snow, or the like), add 100 to the result from (4), otherwise add
nothing to the result from (4).
Each  hour that the character is exposed to glare conditions,  he
must  roll  1D100 against the value in step 5. If  this  roll  of
1D100  is less than or equal to the result from step 5, then  the
character  is  not  dazzled. If this  dazzle  avoidance  roll  is
failed,  the character may attempt a Control of Self  skill  roll
(if  he has this skill at a non-zero percentage) -- if he  fails,
then the character is dazzled. If the dazzle roll is fumbled, the
character is snowblind.

Dazzle:  Dazzled  characters halve all sight based OBS,  and  all
ACC, ATT, PAR skills for the duration of the dazzle. In addition,
dazzled characters halve all vehicular operations, skiing,  snow-
shoeing, and similar skills.

Dazzle recovers if a CON x 2 roll on 1D100 is made (attempts  may
be made once for each hour in which the character is NOT  exposed
to  glare conditions). Each hour that a character is dazzled  and
remains  exposed to glare conditions, he risks snowblindness:  he
must roll CON x 2 or less on 1D100 (modified as per the  original
dazzle  avoidance  chance) to avoid snowblindness (a  Control  of
Self  skill roll, if made, will prevent the snowblindness  for  1
hour).
 

                    ICE WORLD I (PART 16 OF 28)

Snowblind: A snowblind character is blind. He uses all weapons at
the  -50% blinded penalty, and is NOT ALLOWED to use  any  sight-
based observation skill (the psionic talent AWARENESS skill  may,
however, be substituted). Recovery from snowblindness occurs on a
CON  roll or less on 1D100, which may be attempted once per  hour
in which the character is not exposed to glare conditions; howev-
er, if the character is exposed to glare conditions for CON hours
while  snowblind,  the condition becomes  permanent  (subject  to
medical aid).

Given a medical facility (the equivalent of a starship sickbay) a
single exercise of the Medical Skill for the character's  species
will  restore sight to a snowblinded character. If the  character
was permanently blinded, a transplant will be necessary  (requir-
ing  4 hours); otherwise, only "simple" medical treatment of  the
eye damage is required (and 1 hour is needed).

These  Star  type dazzle factors are based on the square  of  the
luminosity of the primary x 100.

These  orbital dazzle factors are based on the inverse square  of
the orbital distance x 100.

Frostbite: Frostbite is a familiar hazard facing individual's  in
subzero  conditions. It results when flesh is exposed  to  suffi-
ciently subnormal temperatures for sufficient lengths of time  --
and  the  exposed flesh quite literally freezes. The  chances  of
frostbite occurrence are regulated by the Wind Chill Table, which
divides various apparent air temperature results into three zones
of  frostbite hazard: "safe", "danger", and "great  danger".  The
ambient  air  temperature and wind speeds must  be  modified  for
clothing,  fur and/or shelter protection (as appropriate)  before
the apparent temperature is determined.

The  "safe"  zone offers little chance of frostbite:  a  roll  of
((CON  x 10) + apparent air temperature) or less on  1D100  means
that frostbite has not developed. If the apparent air temperature
is above freezing (0o C), frostbite will NOT occur. This roll  is
made for each two hours that the character is exposed to tempera-
tures in the "safe" zone (where the apparent temperature is below
freezing). If the roll is failed, either a Control of Self or  an
Arctic  Survival  skill roll may be attempted --  and  if  either
succeeds, no frostbite damage is taken.

In  the "danger" zone, a roll of ((CON x 7) +  apparent  tempera-
ture) or less on 1D100 must be made every 5 turns (10 minutes) or
frostbite  damage is taken. If the roll is failed, a  Control  of
Self or an Arctic Survival skill roll may be attempted -- and  if
either is successful, no frostbite damage is taken.


                    ICE WORLD I (PART 17 OF 28)

In  the  "great  danger" zone, a roll of ((CON x  4)  +  apparent
temperature)  or less on 1D100 must be made every melee round  or
frostbite  damage is taken. If the roll is failed, a  Control  of
Self or an Arctic Survival skill roll may be attempted -- and  if
either is successful, no frostbite damage is taken.

If  frostbite occurs, ALL locations that are not covered or  pro-
tected in some fashion from the environment take 1D4 HIT  damage.
If  all locations are covered or protected, 1D4 damage  is  taken
against total hit points. Visibility: Visibility can sometimes be
a problem in arctic conditions. Reduced visibility can be  caused
by  snowfall  or  by windblown snow; as  necessary,  the  Referee
should  roll  on the Visibility table to  determine  the  maximum
sighting range.

Attacks made against targets at greater than the maximum sighting
range  are  made blind, with a 50% penalty.  Lasers  are  totally
ineffective against targets beyond the sighting range.

SURVIVAL TECHNIQUES

Characters in subzero settings are faced with the most  difficult
of  all survival situations. Some special points must be  consid-
ered when attempting to overcome the hazards of the arctic.

Improvised Shelter: Shelters of varying quality and effectiveness
can be improvised from natural materials as needed.

An  emergency  shelter  can be built by digging a  hole  in  deep
and/or  hard packed snow. The sides screen out some  wind  (treat
winds as half their actual speed before adjusting wind chill  for
clothing worn), but do nothing against the other elements.
