     9.2.13.1 BRIEF BACKGROUND
 
       The Khromatai are a bipedal telempathic race capable of 
quadrupedal  movement.   The race is more of a  family  than  one 
race, which will be detailed further later.  Khromatai as a whole
are a mammilian, omnivorous race modified by genetic engineering.
 
       Thrae, the world of their origin, has a surface gravity of
1.25  times  that  of  Earth, and orbits  an  F5  star  (Illiyha) 
somewhere beyond  the  frontiers  of the  Hegemony.   Speculation
and old records place the Illiyhen system somewhere in the Large
Megellanic Cloud.  These same records indicate that the Khromatai
attained sentience during their journey of unknown length inside
their great "star swimmers"  and were genetically created, but no 
records exist  as to who created them.  What is known is that 
about 1000 years after `The Awakening' they reached their current
home in the Pleiades cluster.

       The Khromatai are decended from a number of mammilian
species modified to the extent that individual physical 
differences are mostly cosmetic while the physiology is nearly
homogenus.  There are eight  distinct phenotypes that have
evolved, along with a ninth phenotype combining the dominant
traits of the other eight and is so called the `mixed' or
homogenus tribe.  Seven phenotypes vaguely resemble terran
mammals and have `common names' describing their features:
Felids, Cervids, Ursids, Mustelids, Lepids, Vulpids and
Rodentids.  The last phenotype was once an offshoot of the larger
mustelid tribe, is now a separate group of ermine.  Each
phenotype has a distinctive society akin to pre-Imperial Earth.
Although the Khromatai as a race are not as gregarious as humans,
they are still a very social race.
 
    All Khromatai walk bipedally digitgrade but are capable of
running quadruped. This later ability is apparently a holdover in
their evolution and is slowly being phased out by sucessive
generations. The Khromat tail is somewhat prehensile, and has
been known to act as extra finger when necessary, though it has
no strength to lift anything over a kilogram. A crest of mane-
like fur runs from the forehead to just below the shoulder
blades, fading into the denser body fur, and is culturally cut
styled to suit the individual's aestetics.  A Khromat has a
natural ability (30% base) to alter the color of the fur,
allowing the Khromat to blend in with the natural surroundings,
as well as express emotions.  Khromatai live an average of 480
years.
 
    The Khromatai settled space as a loose confederation of
planets, with the original group of planets divided up one for
each kafaren (the phenotype `tribes'). The central world, Evwol,
is the gateway to the rest of the Cshastei, including:  Astraea,
cultural center of the Cshastei and omafar ("first-home") to the
Mus'Chirlai; Bait A'Jausa, omafar to the Vak'Pannlai and
Manufacturing capital; Euterpe, omafar of the Hles'Chirlai;
K'Velen of the Emkharnae and the Diplomatic Corps; Medenagan,
agricultural center and  omafar to the Kerv'Dirlai; Mystriah of
the Femilirilai and trade center for the Cshastei; Pallmarrica, 
nominally `first-home' to the S'Chasslai but more important in 
its scientific reasearch; Simfasudan, first world of the 
Rusagralai, and Vrrt'Fiheit of the T'Chiklai; there were just
over 90 worlds within the Cshastei at the time of its 
assimilation into the Hegemony.  There has always been a strong 
sense of competition between the kafarai with little of the 
bloodshed of human history, although some bloodly confrontations
have been known.  The Khromat Cshastei, their intersystem ruling 
body, is a republican democracy, as well as are most of the local
governments.  Those governments not patterned like the Cshastei
can be just about anything from a monarchy to anarchy to a few 
that has no analog in human politics.

is the gateway to the rest of the Cshastei, including:  Astraea,

body, is a republican democracy, as well as are most of the local
governments.  Those governments not patterned like the Cshastei
can be just about anything from a monarchy to anarchy to a few 
that has no analog in human politics.

    The line of decent is more determined by culture than
biology, but as a general rule offspring trace their lines
through their same-sex parent and/or through that parent whose
career the offspring chooses to pursue.  Since some cultures have
group  parenting,  open  adoption, and other  methods  of  child-
rearing, one can never be sure who is the parent of whom.  The 
Khromatai are polygamous by nature and most of their cultures 
reflect this and all marriage forms --including interratial and 
interspecial-- are considered respectable (if a bit odd) by the 
other cultures.
 
    The Khromat race has been known of in the Hegemony since the
Third Expansion, but since no active attempt was made by the
Khromatai to join or fight the Hegemony (seeing that they were
content enough by themselves), they were forgotten and all but
lost to Hegemonic records until the beginning of the Fifth
Expansion.
 
  9.2.13.1.1 Characteristic Differences of the Khromatai
 
    Because of their geneticly engineered background, all
Khromatai are biologically the same regardless of their
phenotype.  Natural evolution has been very slow, however, to
completely eradicate the racial distinctions between the kafarai,
and so there are some minor changes in characteristics that
reflect this:
 
    Kafaren       Modifiers
    Emkharnae     CHA +4, DEX +2, LEN -10
    Femlirilai    CHA +2, LEN -5, TSC & TPR 3d10
    Hles'Chirlai  CON +3, LEN -20
    Kerv'Dirlai   END 4d12, DEX -4, LEN +20
    Mus'Chirlai   DEX +2
    S'Chasslai    no modifiers needed
    T'Chiklai     STR -2, DEX +4, LEN -30
    Rusagralai    STR +6, BLD +3, LEN +30
    Vak'Pannlai   INT +2, LEN +10
 
       The original characteristics listed is the mean average of
the entire race and so, as a result, is the characteristics of
the S'Chasslai kafaren, therefore no modifiers are necessary.
For those modifiers that are a dice roll, replace the S'Chasslai
roll with the modifier.  The expected and species maximum numbers
should also be changed by the modifiers for the individual
kafaren. (For example, the Vak'Pannlai Intellegence maximum is 26
instead of 24 as the unmodified roll of 3d6+2 is now 3d6+4.)
 
       The S'Chasslai are a special kafaren for the `mixed'
khromatai.  The kafarai are the next social group of importance 
above  the  extended  family,  and so  they  are  very  important 
to the khromat psyche.  Because of khromat genetics, there is  a
very high percentage of fertile hybreds from the union of between
khromat and any other mammilian.  This has caused over the course
of centuries enough half-khromatai and mixed-khromatai that would
not easily be recognized within a parent's kafaren to cause 
emotional duress, and so the S'Chasslai clan was formed.  
S'Chasslai can look like anything, from a antlered fox to a bushy 
horse-tailed rabbit to a human with a short nap of polychromatic
fur: the only requirement to join the kafaren is proof of at 
least one Khromat in the applicant's lineage.


    9.2.13.1.2 Ancient Weapons of the Khromatai
 
       The braidwhip is a series of obsidian balls attached to
the neck crest by a leather thong braided into the hair. It is a
class H1 type B weapon, 0.8 meters long and weighs 0.5 kilograms.
It has 12 hit points, does 1d4 of damage, and its training costs
are as follows: 100/150/400/600/800.  The braidwhip costs 15 smu.
 
       The tailspur is a scythe designed to fit snugly over the
end of the tail.  It is a class J1 type S/T, 0.6 meters long and
weighs 1.8 kilograms.  It has 25 hit points, does 1d6+1 damage,
and its training costs are as follows: 75/150/300/450/600.  The
tailspur costs 50 smu.
 
     9.2.13.2 NAMES AMONG THE KHROMATAI
 
       A Khromat has three names: a kafaren name, a given name,
and a `chosen' or family name.  When addressing a Khromat for the
first time or as an occassional acquaintance, it is proper to
speak their kafaren before their given and chosen names.  The
kafarai are listed below:
 
       common name       plural form    singular form
       Ermine            Emkharnae      Emkharnen
       Felid             Femlirilai     Femlirilen
       Lepid             Hles'Chirlai   Hles'Chirlen
       Cervid            Kerv'Dirlai    Kerv'Dirlen
       Mustelid          Mus'Chirlai    Mus'Chirlen
       'Mixed'           S'Chasslai     S'Chasslen
       Rodentid          T'Chiklai      T'Chiklen
       Ursid             Rusagralai     Rusagralen
       Vulpid            Vak'Pannlai    Vak'Pannlen
 
 
    For the majority of the Khromat race, given names are pretty
much arbitrary with the only rules being female names end in
vowels (a,e,i,o,u, and h in combination with any standard vowel
to make a shortened `long vowel' sound, as in Shaneh which is
pronounced shaw-NI) and all male names end in soft consonents
(r,n,b,d,l,s,kh, and rr which is a purr-sound).  Parents usually
choose names that reflect something important to them, some
event that occured at the child's birth, or the name of someone
they wish to remember.
 
    For example, Emkharnae Micole and Micah are twins who were
born when the Greater Moon of Pallmarrica was rising. Micole is
the elder, hence Mi-cole (Mii means `moon' and Acole means
`rise') and her sister is Mi-cah (Iicah means `high' or `risen').
In H'Tosslii all vowels are pronounced separately and have no
`long' and `short' sound (unless combined with an 'h'), but some
of the older tongues have the double vowel sounds, so in the
above example their names can be pronounced either  /MEE-kol-e/
and /MEE-kaw-h/ or /MY-kaul-e/ and /MY-kay/, depending on the
person's liguistic background, but all vowels should be
pronounced individually.


    The 'Chosen' names of Khromatai are titles of record taken at
adulthood, and can be one of two different types. The most common
chosen name is that of the parent the offspring traces his or her
line  or career from.  Take the chosen parent's name and add  one 
of the following endings:
 
    -ica or -ika if character is female (means "Daughter")
    -isen if character is male (means "Son")
    -aseh if character is male or female (means "Child")
 
    For example, Micole chose to follow in her father's
footsteps.  Her full name is then Micole Khemarrica, after her
father Khemarr.
 
    The other type of chosen name is derived from the character's
profession or some aspect of it.  Some common names include:
 
    Frrinsen    = Forester (Frrin = `tree')
    Mik'Farlen  = Explorer (Mik' = `study',  Afar = `world')
    Chishasta   = Starchaser (Chishe = `hunt' or  `chase',
                  Asta = `star')
    Vinsoonen   = Seaman (Vinsoon = `sea')
    Semasasen   = Dancer (Semasa = `[to] dance')
    Mannasen    = Artist (Manni = `art' or `create')
    Liiafar     = Teacher (Liia = `learn',  Afar = `world')
    Akuaseh     = Waterchild (Akuu = `water')
    Nefiir      = Firestone (Neh = `stone',  Fiir = `fire')
 
    Micole's older brother, Jonnathan, became an interpreter for
a merchant company.  He chose as his full name Jonnathan
Asteilii, meaning Jonnathan Many-Stars'-Language (Astae = stars
and -lii = language).
 
    The Khromat Vak'Pannlai and Kerv'Dirlai have extended family
units called clans.  Where [P1] is the clan name, [P3] is the
given name of the individual, and [P2] is the gender particle (no
for  females, nen for males), the full name of the individual
would be [P1]+[P2]+[P3], not including the kafaren name.
 
    If, for instance, you were to meet a female Khromat fox named
Semasali from the Akiila clan for the first time, her name full
formal name would be Vak'Pannlen Akiila no Semesali.  The
familiar form would be just her given name, Semesali, or a
nickname which maybe the translation of her full name:  for
Akiila no Semesali it would be Dancing Hawk.
 
    For the Kerv'Dirlai, the familiar form would be his or her
given name plus the suffix -(a)lie for females and -alin for
males to denote belonging to a clan family.
 
    Nicknames are common for all Khromatai.
 

     9.2.13.3 KHROMAT LANGUAGES
 
       Every khromat speaks at least three languages:
 
     9.2.13.3.1 Kafarai Tongues
 
       85% of all Khromatai speak their kafaren tongue as their
native language (the kafaren tongue name is the kafaren root word
plus the suffix -lii eg. Femlirilii).  There are several
languages which have more specialized uses that can also be
spoken as a native language, but less than 6% of the population
speaks these specialized tongues as a native.  The rest of the
Khromatai speak H'Tosslii, their non-Khromat parent's language,
or speak S'Chasslii even if they are not of that kafaren (it is
considered the easiest of the kafarai tongues to learn and so is
commonly spoken by everyone dealing with other races).  Special
note:  all Khromatai native to Evwol speak H'Tosslii at their
speak/read Own Language base, and their `native' tongue at the
H'Tosslii base listed below.  A Khromat speaks his or her native
tongue at a base of INTx6, and read/writes at a base of INTx5.
 
     9.2.13.3.2 H'Tosslii
 
       H'Tosslii, or Universal Khromat, is similar to L'Doran as
being an artifical language to standardize the race.  The Khromat
Cshastei has been slowly converting the race to H'Tosslii as its
primary language, and all proper names are written in H'Tosslii.
Evwol, being the capitol of the Cshastei, is the first (and
currently, only) world to have its population speak H'Tosslii as
a `native' language, with the change in language base shown
above.  A Khromat speaks H'Tosslii at a base of INTx5, and
read/writes H'Tosslii at a base of INTx4.
 
     9.2.13.3.3 Khiomemaii
 
       Khiomemaii, the language of color, is not a writable
language.  It uses the Khromat's inherant abilities of camouflage
to communicate to one another a complex body-language.  Khromatai
`speak' Khiomemaii with a 30% base, and is trainable only through
their natural camouflage ability, hence the Natural Camouflage
skill directly relates on their `speaking' ability of the
language.  Races with similar camouflage abilities (i.e. Crest
Cats) can learn the language and have it listed under Languages,
but training is separate from their Natural Camouflage Skill.
Non-camouflage races can also learn the language, but will
require a `Hololator' (a visual translator computer) to actually
'speak' it.


     9.2.13.4 THE KHROMAT OUTLOOK
 
       1) There is a passion for physical pleasure and the
investigation of the universe (they are hedonists and are
polygamous by nature, although not all choose to be so).
       2) The seven cardinal virtues are: curiosity, courage,
honor, imagination, empathy, mental agility, and a sense of
humor.
       3) Strength of will and character, compassion, and
tenacity are also considered important.
       4) Only these virtues justify power over another
intellegent life form.
       5) Virtue is both a means to an end and rewarding in its
own right.
       6) There is a basic natural law governing all intellegent
life forms.
       7) Under this law, all intellegent life forms are
basically equal, though their abilities may differ.
 
 
       Attitudes of the Khromat Upper/Middle Class
 
    Characteristic         Khromat Attitude
    `Human' equality       Axiomatic
    World View             Optimistic (hedonist)
