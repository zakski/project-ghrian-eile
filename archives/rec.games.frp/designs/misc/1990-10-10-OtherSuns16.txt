                       HOW HIGH CAN I JUMP?
 
   Suppose  we  have a standing man with a center  of  mass  h0
   meters  off  the  ground.  He is not moving,  so  his  total
   energy  is in potential form (mass x gee x height of  center
   of  mass).   Now suppose that he jumps straight  up.   While
   he's  still  moving, he obviously isn't at the  "peak"  (the
   maximum  height) of his jump.  When he reaches  the  maximum
   height,  his kinetic energy will again be zero, and  all  of
   his energy will be potential.
 
   Suppose  in an arbitrary gravity field?
 
   We assume no external levers are used (as in pole vault) and
   that we can ignore air resistance.
 
   The  change in total energy of the man in the jump  is  also
   assumed  to  be constant (we assume that the  man's  muscles
   work no more or less efficiently over the range of  gravita-
   tional values considered).
 
   Since in 1 gee, the man's total energy at the maximum height
   is simply h1 x m x g, the change in total energy will be (h1
   -  h0) x m x g.  If this change in energy is constant,  then
   the  change  in  height of the center of  gravity  when  the
   maximum height is reached will be inversely proportional  to
   the change in the gravity field strength.
 
   So,  if  a man can jump to a height of H meters in a  1  gee
   field,  he will be able to jump to a height of (H-h0) x N  +
   h0  meters  in a 1/N gee field.  Obviously,  the  lower  the
   value  of h0, the better the final jump height will  be  (in
   other  words, crouch down low, and use your legs to jump  --
   don't try to "jump with your toes").  But the maximum height
   reached by the center of mass in a jump does not vary exact-
   ly inversely with the strength of the gravity field.

                       POWERGUNS for OTHER SUNS
       An adaptation of the principal handgun in David Drake's
          HAMMER'S SLAMMERS science fiction future history
  
  A  Powergun  does 30 points of damage per charge.   The  magazine 
  holds  30 plastic "wafers" (the charges).  There is  an  attached 
  liquid nitrogen cannister used in cooling the firing chamber  and 
  the  ejector head; the coolant cannister contains sufficient  gas 
  to cool 900 points.
  
  Cooling  is  at the rate of 5 points per second (so 6 seconds  of 
  cooling  after a discharge will reduce chamber  temperature  from 
  the  30  point level of firing to the 0 point level of  jam  free 
  repeated firing).   Chamber temperature is increased by an amount 
  equal  to  the damage point value of the charge plus the  chamber 
  temperature just prior to firing.  Probability of a JAM following 
  firing is 2 x Chamber temperature BEFORE firing as a  percentage.  
  Chamber temperature decreases naturally by 0.1 points each second 
  that the weapon is not fired.
  
  To  unjam requires use of the ARMORER skill:   30 points of "jam" 
  must be cleared (at 1D10 points cleared per successful use of the 
  skill).   Each use of the ARMORER skill in this instance requires 
  30/[skill level] seconds (so a 50% armorer will spend 60 seconds, 
  and a 75% armorer will spend 40 seconds per attempt).

  Powerguns may not be fired in wide beam mode -- like lasers  they 
  are pinpoint beams.
