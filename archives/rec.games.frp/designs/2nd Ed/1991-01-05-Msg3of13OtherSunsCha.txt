      OTHER SUNS -- COPYRIGHT 1982, 1991 by N. C. Shapero
           Chapter 2:  Characteristics  (Part 3 of 13)
*****************************************************************
     To  provide a running series of examples for the  reader  we 
will  be  presenting the tale of Mikhail  Andreivitch  throughout 
this book.  For now, let's roll up his characteristics...

STR=12--A  high  average  STR, allowing Mikhail  to  handle  most 
weapons  without  penalties.  See CHAPTER 10,  COMBAT,  for  more 
details on the precise limits involved.

INT=17--An excellent roll.  As will be seen later, it gives him a 
number of advantages in gaining expertise in skills.  His  start-
ing  skills will also be much improved (see CHAPTER  6,  PREVIOUS 
EXPERIENCE) by this high intelligence.

WIL=9--A  below  average roll.  So Mikhail's force  of  will  and 
strength of ego are, perhaps, a little bit below average, but not 
enough  to  cause him any serious difficulty.  However,  his  WIL 
score is sufficiently low that he might as well give up any  hope 
of  developing anything of the psionic "wild talents"  until  his 
WIL score can be improved (see CHAPTER 8, PSIONICS AND THE USE OF 
WILL for more details).

CON=9--A  below  average roll.  And Mikhail Andreivitch  will  be 
somewhat vulnerable to disease and poison.  Obviously, the Man of 
Steel he is not.

END=22--A strictly average roll.  So Mikhail is able to take just 
about as much pain as the next person before passing out, and  of 
working just about as hard (STR and CON permitting).

DEX=18--The  highest roll for a Human.  Obviously,  what  Mikhail 
lacks in bodily strength and toughness, he more than makes up for 
in  speed and agility.  He will be able to use all equipment  and 
weapons  a bit better than average as a result of his  quick  re-
flexes and great agility.

CHA=13--At this point, Mikhail is a bit above average as a  lead-
er.  This has nothing to do with his looks.

LEN=180--Mikhail is 180 centimeters tall, or roughly 5'11".

BLD=9--Mikhail  is not particularly heavily boned, but he  is  no 
lightweight either -- just on the low side of average.

TSC=1--Mikhail  is an active telepath, though a poor one  by  the 
standards of the era.  His range is only 10 meters, and he has  a 
10% chance of communicating with another equally adept telepath.

TPR=3--A  typical  average telepathic  resistance.   So  Mikhail, 
though  telepathic himself, has no particularly great  resistance 
to telepathic probes and/or attacks.  Yet.
