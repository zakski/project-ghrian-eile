           Chapter 2:  Characteristics  (Part 7 of 13)
LUCK (LUC)

Luck may be described as the ability to fall into a compost  heap 
and find a diamond.  Unlike most the other abilities listed, Luck 
is given as a straight point value.  Depending upon the difficul-
ties  or the odds involved, a player will have roll at  or  below 
some  multiple (between one and six) for this  characteristic  on 
1D100  in  order to have "made a luck roll".  This  procedure  is 
refered to elsewhere in the rules as a "characteristic roll"  (in 
this case, for LUC).

     LUC = (INT + WIL) / 2

where fractions are rounded up to the next largest whole number.  

*****************************************************************
Mikhail has a luck of 13, computed as follows:
     (INT + WIL)/2 = (17 + 9)/2 = 26/2 = 13.
Mikhail's  high intelligence more than compensates for his  below 
average  will, resulting in a luck value of 13 (well above  aver-
age).
*****************************************************************

                        ABILITIES BONUSES
             AND HOW CHARACTERISTICS INFLUENCE THEM

Each  character has various skills which he will be able  to  im-
prove  through training and experience; his characteristics  will 
influence how well he will do in each category of skill.

Positive modifiers add to the category bonus, negative  modifiers 
subtract from the characteristic bonus.  Primary modifiers  modi-
fiers add (subtract) twice the characteristic value to (from) the 
category  bonus.  Secondary modifiers add (subtract) the  charac-
teristic value to (from) the category bonus.  Tertiary  modifiers 
add  (subtract) one half the characteristic value to  (from)  the 
category bonus.

All primary, secondary, and tertiary positive and negative  modi-
fiers  are  added, then the Finagle Factor is then added  to  the 
result  to give the final category bonus; the Finagle Factor  has 
been  defined so that a typical Human character will have a  zero 
category bonus.
