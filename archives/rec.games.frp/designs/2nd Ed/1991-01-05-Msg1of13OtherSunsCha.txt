           Chapter 2:  Characteristics  (Part 1 of 13)
                         CHARACTERISTICS

To  create an Adventurer, the player rolls dice for each  of  the 
following characteristics.  This provides the basic parameters of 
the  Adventurer's development.  The die rolls given are  for  hu-
mans.   Other intelligent races may use different die  rolls  for 
the various characteristics.  These differences are dealt with in 
CHAPTER 4, INTELLIGENT SPECIES.

1.   Strength  (STR):   helps determine the  damage  a  character 
does,  how much equipment he can carry, and what weapons  he  may 
use.  Strength can be increased through training up to the rating 
for  the character's Constitution or Size, which ever is  larger.  
Humans roll for strength on 3D6.

2.   Intelligence  (INT):  the character's ability to  deal  with 
abstractions  and  to learn from  experience.   Intelligence  for 
humans  in  the general population is rolled  on  3D6.   However, 
adventurous characters -- the spacers, the scientists, the  space 
merchants -- are all a cut above average.  Thus all human  adven-
turing  characters (i.e. all player run humans) roll for  INT  on 
2D6+6.

3.   WILL (WIL):  the character's strength of will and ego --  an 
important  factor in the ability to resist and/or  power  certain 
kinds of psionic attack and possibly to affect the world  through 
direct  force  of will (see CHAPTER 7, PSIONICS AND  THE  USE  OF 
WILL).  Will is also a measure of the char acter's overall  self-
confidence.   Will  can be increased through training up  to  the 
species maximum.  Humans roll for Will on 3D6.

4.   Constitution  (CON):  the character's health.  It  helps  de 
termine how much punishment (in combat or otherwise) a  character 
can  take before he dies.  Constitution can be increased  through 
training up to the maximum of Strength or Size.  Constitution  is 
rolled  on  3D6 for humans in the general  population.   However, 
adventurous characters -- the spacers, the scientists, the  space 
merchants,  are  all a cut above average.  Thus  all  adventuring 
characters  (i.e.  all  player run characters) roll  for  CON  on 
2D6+6.

5.   Endurance (END):  the character's ability to withstand  pain 
and  to  engage in strenuous activity for  prolonged  periods  of 
time.  Endurance is also a factor in determining how much  physi-
cal punishment a character can take.  Endurance can be  increased 
through  training up to species maximum.  Humans roll for  endur-
ance on 4D10.
