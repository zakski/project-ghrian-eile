      OTHER SUNS -- COPYRIGHT 1982, 1991 by N. C. Shapero
           Chapter 2:  Characteristics  (Part 2 of 2)
6.   Dexterity  (DEX):  the character's ability to  move  quickly 
and  accurately.  Dexterity may be increased through training  up 
to species maximum.  Humans roll for dexterity on 3D6.

7.   Charisma (CHA):  the character's ability to lead.  It is the 
ability  to  say "follow me" and find oneself leading  a  charge.  
Charisma  is subject to change (both up and down) depending  upon 
the  success  or failure of previous ventures.  Humans  roll  for 
charisma on 3D6.

8.   Length  (LEN):  the height of the character, in  centimeters 
(1  inch = 2.54 centimeters; 1 centimeter = 0.394 inches).   This 
characteristic  determines the reach of the character.   It  also 
helps  determine  the overall body mass of the  char  acter,  the 
principal factor in the amount of total damage the character  can 
take  before  dying.   It is assumed that  all  Adventurers  have 
reached their full growth prior to entering play, so this charac-
teristic  cannot  increase during the course  of  the  characters 
career.  Humans roll for LEN on 110+6D20 for male characters, and 
on 100+6D20 for female characters.

9.   Build (BLD):  the massiveness of the character's bone  struc 
ture  --  indicating how stocky, and how bulky  the  Adventurer's 
body is -- the higher the roll, the stockier the build.  It is an 
important factor in determining the overall size of the character 
(and hence his ability to withstand damage).  This characteristic 
may  only  change by one point from the original  roll  once  the 
Adventurer  has  begun his career.  Human males roll for  BLD  on 
3D6, human females roll for BLD on 3D4+1.

10.  Telepathic  Strike  Capability (TSC):  the  measure  of  the 
character's ability to launch telepathic attacks, to probe minds, 
and  to handle psionic devices.  There is no species maximum  for 
TSC  and no limit to the amount of training that may  be  applied 
towards  increasing this characteristic. Humans roll for  TSC  on 
1D6-5.  Characters  with  TSC less than or equal to  0  are  non-
telepathic (though they may be trained).

11.  Telepathic Resistance (TPR):  the measure of the character's 
resistance to telepathic probes and attacks.  There is no species 
maximum for telepathic resistance, and TPR may be trained without 
limit.  Humans roll for telepathic resistance on 1D4+1.
