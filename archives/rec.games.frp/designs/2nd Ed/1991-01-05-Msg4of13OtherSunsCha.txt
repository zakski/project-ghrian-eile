      OTHER SUNS -- COPYRIGHT 1982, 1991 by N. C. Shapero
           Chapter 2:  Characteristics  (Part 4 of 13)
MIKHAIL'S POTENTIAL INCREASES

STR--Mikhail's STR can be increased to 20 (his SIZ).

INT--Failing some incredible miracle, Mikhail will be stuck  with 
his current INT (not that he would complain, mind you)

WIL--This  characteristic may be increased up to species  maximum 
eventually, though Mikhail has a long way to go here.

CON--Mikhail  may  increase  his CON, as explained  later,  to  a 
maximum of 20 (his SIZ).

END--This  attribute can be increased to the species maximum,  as 
explained  later,  though in Mikhail's case it  would  take  many 
months of training to do so.

DEX--This  attribute can be increased to the species maximum,  as 
explained later.

CHA--As  shown  later,  Mikhail's CHA will  rise  and  fall  with 
events.

LEN--As  with INT, Mikhail is stuck with his current length.   He 
is  assumed  to have finished his growth by the  time  he  enters 
play.

BLD--Though difficult, it would be possible for Mikhail to change 
his  BLD by 1 point (either up or down).  See Increasing  Charac-
teristics later in this chapter for further details.

TSC--The sky is the limit for Mikhail in this area.

TPR--Here  again,  the  sky is the limit,  though  training  this 
characteristic is both expensive and time consuming.
*****************************************************************

MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM CHARACTERISTICS

No characteristic save TSC and TPR may be increased by any  means 
save cyborging (see CHAPTER 12, HEGEMONIC TECHNOLOGY) beyond  the 
maximum  amount  rollable  on the characteristic  dice  plus  the 
number of dice rolled (plus one if an adder is present).  Thus  a 
human  may  not have a dexterity higher than 21  (=18+3),  and  a 
Korli  with  dexterity rolled on 3D6+6 may not have  a  dexterity 
higher than 28 (= 24 + 3 + 1).

The minimum characteristic possible for any reason is the  number 
of  dice rolled (for example, 3 for human CON).  No  characteris-
tics save END and WIL may be reduced below this point  voluntari-
ly.   If WIL is reduced below zero, however, the character  dies, 
and  no  amount of medical assistance will prevent his  death  or 
later restore him to life.
